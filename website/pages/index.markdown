@title Evergreen

Evergreen is an open source, productivity-style feed reader for Macs.

It’s at a very early stage — we use it, but we don’t expect other people to use it yet.

Nevertheless, you can:

<a href="https://ranchero.com/downloads/Evergreen-latest.zip">Download the latest build</a>

<a href="https://github.com/brentsimmons/Evergreen/issues">Report bugs and make feature requests</a>

<a href="https://github.com/brentsimmons/Evergreen">Checkout the code</a>

Also note: [Evergreen has its own blog](https://ranchero.com/evergreen/blog/). (The blog is one of the default feeds in Evergreen.)

#### To Do

Again — it’s barely usable at this point. Not even that. It’s not beta — it’s not even *alpha*. 

What remains to be done is pretty much obvious. Tons of stuff.

However, a few notes about the future:

* We don’t plan on doing an iOS version ever. We might change our minds, but we doubt it. (Update Dec. 5, 2017: Well, maaaaaybe…)
* We don’t plan on making a for-pay version ever, either. We might change our minds, but it’s massively unlikely. [This app is written for love](http://inessential.com/2015/06/30/love), not money.
* Future versions will add syncing via existing services (such as [FeedBin](https://feedbin.com/), [Feedly](https://feedly.com/), [Feed Wrangler](https://feedwrangler.net/), and others), though we make no promises about which ones and when. (This means that, some time in the future, you could use Evergreen on your Mac and [Unread](http://supertop.co/unread/), [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/ios/), or other feed reader on your iPhone and iPad.)
* You’re free to use the code and make your own feed reader, even on iOS. It’s MIT-licensed. Just give us credit and call it something besides Evergreen.
