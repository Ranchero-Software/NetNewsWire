@title Evergreen

Evergreen is a free and open source feed reader for macOS.

It’s at a very early stage — we use it, but we don’t expect other people to use it yet.

Nevertheless, you can:

#### To Do

Again — it’s barely usable at this point. Not even that. It’s not beta — it’s not even *alpha*. 

What remains to be done is pretty much obvious. Tons of stuff.

However, a few notes about the future:

* We don’t plan on doing an iOS version ever. We might change our minds, but we doubt it. (Update Dec. 5, 2017: Well, maaaaaybe…)
* We don’t plan on making a for-pay version ever, either. We might change our minds, but it’s massively unlikely. [This app is written for love](http://inessential.com/2015/06/30/love), not money.
* Future versions will add syncing via existing services (such as [FeedBin](https://feedbin.com/), [Feedly](https://feedly.com/), [Feed Wrangler](https://feedwrangler.net/), and others), though we make no promises about which ones and when. (This means that, some time in the future, you could use Evergreen on your Mac and [Unread](http://supertop.co/unread/), [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/ios/), or other feed reader on your iPhone and iPad.)

#### Technical Notes

Evergreen supports <a href="http://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">Atom</a>, <a href="https://jsonfeed.org/">JSON Feed</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/rss-in-json/README.md">RSS-in-JSON</a>.

Evergreen requires macOS 10.13.

#### About Using the Code

You’re free to use the code and make your own app, even on iOS. It’s MIT-licensed. Just give us credit and call it something besides Evergreen.

In fact, <i>please do</i> use any or all of this code. If you can learn from it — things to do or things *not* to do — then great! Creating a full-featured example Mac app of use to other developers is one of our goals.

Most of the code is written in Swift. Some older parts, particularly in the frameworks, are written in Objective-C. We think this is one of the largest open source Mac apps written mostly in Swift.

#### About the name

Evergreen is made in Seattle and is named for Washington, the Evergreen State. The author, who attended The Evergreen State College, has two evergreen trees in his yard.

But the name is a prayer for the open web — may it remain evergreen.
