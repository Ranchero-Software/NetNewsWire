While there is still so much to do — GitHub says we’re just 36% of the way (at this writing) toward completing the <a href="https://github.com/brentsimmons/Evergreen/milestone/1">1.0 alpha milestone</a> — Evergreen is getting closer and closer to actually usable.

The latest build (1.0d25) adds keyboard shortcuts, so you can (for instance) go through all your news via the space bar. (You can read about <a href="http://inessential.com/2017/12/20/wkwebview_workarounds">how we got this to work</a>.) You can hit `k` to mark all as read, and so on.

(For a complete list, open the Window menu and choose Keyboard Shortcuts.)

If you want to try it out, you can [download the latest build](https://ranchero.com/downloads/Evergreen-latest.zip).

Note: in the Help menu is a Bug Tracker item — use that to report bugs and make feature requests. (It goes to <a href="https://github.com/brentsimmons/Evergreen/issues">Evergreen’s bug tracker on GitHub</a>.)
