    Note:  strictly, the AppDelegate doesn't appear as part of the scripting model,
    so this file is rather unlike the other Object+Scriptability.swift files.
    However, the AppDelegate object is the de facto scripting accessor for some
    application elements and properties.  For, example, the main window is accessed
    via the AppDelegate's MainWindowController, and the main window itself has
    selected feeds, selected articles and a current article.  This file supplies the glue to access
    these scriptable objects, while being completely separate from the core AppDelegate code,

    NSDeleteCommand is kind of an oddball AppleScript command in that the command dispatch

    figure out what to delete. In the code below, 'receivers' is the container object(s)
    and keySpecifier is the thing to delete, relative to the container(s).  Because there
    is ambiguity about whether specifiers are lists or single objects, the code switches
    based on which it is.
