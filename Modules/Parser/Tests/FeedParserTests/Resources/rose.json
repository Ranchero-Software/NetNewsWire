Unfortunately by default when you make rich text from markdown in Workflow you end up with something like this:<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Example, text is \"here's to the crazy ones\", font is Times New Roman\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/1\/4\/3\/1\/2\/143121be318f8d826e708c0de1ed978199cff1a2-example-without-formatting.jpeg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Yes, that's Times New Roman. Not a font I usually use by choice. Thankfully however it's quite simple to fix this with my Workflow. This can be accomplished in a number of ways, I convert the rich text to HTML, replace the <code>&lt;body&gt;<\/code> tag with one containing a HTML inline style (<code>&lt;body style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"&gt;<\/code>), make rich text from that HTML, and then make the PDF. The body in HTML is where all of your content is, so this will then apply to all of your text. If you just wanted to change the first level of headings, you could replace the <code>&lt;h1&gt;<\/code> tags instead. <\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Example, with modified formatting\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/d\/c\/0\/a\/a\/dc0aaae5e35c5cea795a5e5c430698c4b71d19c9-example-with-formatting.jpeg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is how the whole Workflow runs:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><img title=\"Make Rich Text from Markdown\" alt=\"Make Rich Text from Markdown\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/2\/d\/0\/a\/1\/2d0a16b11ee9efae2448a2c3fb8e53dfd6b6d42d-richtext.png\" \/> <code>Make Rich Text from Markdown<\/code><\/li>\n<li><img title=\"Make HTML from Rich Text\" alt=\"Make HTML from Rich Text\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/2\/d\/0\/a\/1\/2d0a16b11ee9efae2448a2c3fb8e53dfd6b6d42d-richtext.png\" \/> <code>Make HTML from Rich Text<\/code><\/li>\n<li><img title=\"Replace Text\" alt=\"Replace Text\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/c\/3\/b\/9\/9\/c3b990fbda6b0837cd8aa58ac8dc29463235ec95-text.png\" \/> <code>Replace Text<\/code>, this is where I replace the <code>body<\/code> tag.<\/li>\n<li><img title=\"Make Rich Text from HTML\" alt=\"Make Rich Text from HTML\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/2\/d\/0\/a\/1\/2d0a16b11ee9efae2448a2c3fb8e53dfd6b6d42d-richtext.png\" \/> <code>Make Rich Text from HTML<\/code><\/li>\n<li><img title=\"Make PDF\" alt=\"Make PDF\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/1\/0\/9\/7\/4\/1097445bae9c35c53a13ae967b9f8f781f51278f-pdf.png\" \/> <code>Make PDF<\/code>, make sure that <code>include margin<\/code> is enabled otherwise the PDF looks funny.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Bonus: The PDF contains the text as well, so it's searchable and also accessible. All you need to do is to add an action at the end of the Workflow to make it do what you want with it, you could quick look it, share it, open it in another application or save it somewhere you choose!<\/p>\n<p>You can get the simplest workflow here: <a href=\"https:\/\/workflow.is\/workflows\/0f438f7dc4c34b43a3aa02fb108b08d3\">Markdown To Nice PDF<\/a><\/p>\n<p>It would also be possible to link a style sheet, such as the [Pure CSS] one, by adding the css link to the <code>&lt;head&gt;<\/code> tag, the caveat of this is most pre-built CSS files work best when you add classes to sections (e.g. <code>&lt;table&gt;<\/code> would be <code>&lt;table class=\"pure-table\"&gt;<\/code>), which will require many more <code>Replace Text<\/code> actions if you want to account for all the possibilities.<\/p>\n<p>If you want the <a href=\"https:\/\/workflow.is\/workflows\/772806a60f4a4b968f273aa0f0c3eca3\">Pure CSS version<\/a> is also available.<\/p>",

(Not that stickers aren't great of course.)<\/p>\n<h3>Airmail<\/h3>\n<p>If you've ever wanted or needed to send an email attachment via iMessage this is an easy way to do it. You simply get a list of attachments on emails, allowing you to send the file onwards.<\/p>\n<h3>Citymapper<\/h3>\n<p>This particular app is very useful - you can send your current location, a recently searched for destination, or your current trip. Very useful if you're trying to meet up with people!<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"CityMapper iMessage app, showing \"Send location\", sharing a location, and choosing one\" class=\"image-center\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/a\/5\/b\/e\/b\/a5bebedb7bfe9e1ab19d27cb151cde42f26f0596-citymapper.jpeg\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Copied<\/h3>\n<p>I love Copied, it's a great clipboard manager that syncs between iOS and macOS, and you have access to images in it iMessage app. I often share to Copied and then I can use either the keyboard or the iMessage app to share things on.<\/p>\n<h3>Doodle<\/h3>\n<p>If you've ever tried to arrange an event that involves more than one person you've done the back and forth of \"are you free then? No, how about next week? FIne, I give up\" (or similar), Doodle is fabulous to help you fix that - you just create a poll when <em>you<\/em> are available, and everyone votes for the dates that work for them. Well throw that into a group iMessage and you've saved yourself 100 notifications (more or less, depending on the size of the group and how busy their schedules are!).<\/p>\n<h3>Drafts<\/h3>\n<p>I often start my writing in Drafts, regardless of what it is, and now I can grab a Draft and send it via iMessage. It's very useful and helps you avoid that copy and paste dance!<\/p>\n<h3>Dropbox<\/h3>\n<p>If you want to send a file that's stored in Dropbox this is the easiest way. <\/p>\n<h3>Glympse<\/h3>\n<p>I love sharing my location with people to help us find one another, Glympse goes a few steps above Find Friends here. You can choose to share for a time period, or until you get a location - if you do that it calculates the route and shows the person where you are on your route, how fast you're moving, and your estimated arrival time.

With the iMessage app you can search for a location - sorted by nearest to you automatically.

            "content_text": "I was recently asked on Twitter which iMessage apps I use regularly, and thought it might well be worth a blog post - there are some really useful iMessage apps out there, but most people just seem to use stickers! (Not that stickers aren't great of course.)\nAirmail\nIf you've ever wanted or needed to send an email attachment via iMessage this is an easy way to do it. You simply get a list of attachments on emails, allowing you to send the file onwards.\nCitymapper\nThis particular app is very useful - you can send your current location, a recently searched for destination, or your current trip. Very useful if you're trying to meet up with people!\n\nCopied\nI love Copied, it's a great clipboard manager that syncs between iOS and macOS, and you have access to images in it iMessage app. I often share to Copied and then I can use either the keyboard or the iMessage app to share things on.\nDoodle\nIf you've ever tried to arrange an event that involves more than one person you've done the back and forth of \"are you free then? No, how about next week? FIne, I give up\" (or similar), Doodle is fabulous to help you fix that - you just create a poll when you are available, and everyone votes for the dates that work for them. Well throw that into a group iMessage and you've saved yourself 100 notifications (more or less, depending on the size of the group and how busy their schedules are!).\nDrafts\nI often start my writing in Drafts, regardless of what it is, and now I can grab a Draft and send it via iMessage. It's very useful and helps you avoid that copy and paste dance!\nDropbox\nIf you want to send a file that's stored in Dropbox this is the easiest way. \nGlympse\nI love sharing my location with people to help us find one another, Glympse goes a few steps above Find Friends here. You can choose to share for a time period, or until you get a location - if you do that it calculates the route and shows the person where you are on your route, how fast you're moving, and your estimated arrival time. Being able to share it via iMessage is extremely useful, especially as the other person doesn't need to be using Glympse check on you.\nMapstr\nMapstr is one of my favourite apps, I bookmark locations in it all the time, and I frequently want to share them! With the iMessage app you can search for a location - sorted by nearest to you automatically. The shared item results in a map, with the name and tags you have specified - so the person could import it directly if they wanted to.\n\n\nMusic\nI like to share music with people, they probably heard about it months, years, or decades before I came across it, but it's fun nonetheless. With the iMessage app I can send the exact track I'm listening to right now to a friend - or pick something earlier from my playing history.\n\nOneDrive\nThis works the same way the Dropbox app does, but with OneDrive (funny that). It's pretty useful for Word documents I've had to wrangle.\nTripIt\nI travel, a lot. At least compared to some people. I love to use TripIt to share parts of my trip with people. It formats things prettily, while still giving them the information they would want. \n\nWeek Calendar\nI usually invite people to calendar events if they're involved or affected by it, however sometimes that's not practical.

There are many ways you can automatically create calendar events, and it's useful to be able to do so, to avoid losing information. You can also use calendar events as a trigger to do something - which we cover towards the end. Below there are details of all the automations we cover, including 4 (really, four!) screencasts.<\/p>\n<h2>Workflow: Calendar Event Templates<\/h2>\n<p><img title=\"Calendar Event Templates\" alt=\"Calendar Event Templates\" class=\"image-left\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/3\/3\/a\/c\/1\/33ac125fb4203dabea7f6b5cab3bd5189df41cd2-workflow-calendar-event-templates.png\" \/> This is a very simple Workflow which asks me for the date and time of the event, and then what kind of event this is (the demo has 3 examples) - it then adjusts the time to add an appropriate length for the appointment and adds it to my calendar. This is very useful because I can never remember what floor my dentist is on or exactly where to turn to find my hairdresser - so I can add this to the notes. Even if the places you frequent are not hidden like mine are you can still use this!\nYou can get the workflow here: <a href=\"https:\/\/workflow.is\/workflows\/434bd4cf625f419282aee780d3414a4c\">Calendar Event Templates<\/a> Make sure to read on to find out about the \"Run Workflow\" action at the end of it.<\/p>\n<h2>Workflow: Add Event To Work Calendar<\/h2>\n<p><img title=\"Add Event To Work Calendar (Menu)\" alt=\"Add Event To Work Calendar\" class=\"image-right\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/6\/8\/b\/3\/5\/68b350294a420b45025218b4243a665f04e3be4a-workflow-add-event-to-work-calendar.png\" \/> This workflow follows the first one, and is in fact run by it - or could be. It simply asks you if the appointment you've made is during working hours, and if you say yes, adds an event that starts half an hour before and ends half an hour after the appointment you've just created to your calendar. Make sure to tweak the calendar setting here! You can get the workflow here: <a href=\"https:\/\/workflow.is\/workflows\/7028582e422441209e36690ab4621b94\">Add Event To Work Calendar (Menu)<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Of course, you can automate this too, this formats the date of the event as one letter (so Monday becomes M, Friday becomes F), and if it's not Saturday or Sunday, checks if the event starts after 8 am but before 6pm - if yes it adds an event to your calendar. It's not <em>insanely<\/em> complicated, but it's not as simple as the Workflow above.\nYou can get the workflow here: <a href=\"https:\/\/workflow.is\/workflows\/3a0dd365141d4146981c1297148f2a24\">Add Event To Work Calendar (Auto)<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>David's Hyper Scheduling Workflow<\/h2>\n<p><img title=\"Block Schedule\" alt=\"Block Schedule\" class=\"image-left\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/8\/c\/e\/3\/2\/8ce3281452e40dff35fa53fa7160d0318f19d818-workflow-block-schedule.png\" \/> Since February David has had an ongoing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macsparky.com\/blog\/2018\/2\/the-hyper-scheduling-experiment\">Hyper-Scheduling Experiment<\/a>, which involves scheduling blocks of time in his calendar to provide a framework throughout his day.

The simplest repeats are every day\/week\/month\/year, but if you go into the <code>Custom...<\/code> options then you can create repeats such as \"On the first weekday of every month\".<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Simple Repeat Options\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/4\/f\/4\/e\/4\/4f4e4d4aa15b00f1bc702e183e830f77ac49fb6a-calendar-simple-repeat-options.png\" \/>\n<img alt=\"Advanced Weekly Repeat Options\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/2\/8\/9\/1\/5\/28915f4ac1bb1443aa9253ad4b405976cab54957-calendar-weekly-repeat-options.png\" \/>\n<img alt=\"Advanced Monthly Repeat Options\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/5\/d\/5\/d\/1\/5d5d1fa55f8a53df1b9f22745494919f5e755866-calendar-monthly-repeat-options.png\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Copy and paste<\/h2>\n<p>If repeating events count as automation (they do!) then copying and pasting events does as well.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>CMD+D<\/code> allows you to duplicate an event, and then you can drag and drop it.<\/li>\n<li><code>CMD+C<\/code> and then <code>CMD+V<\/code> lets you paste, if you select a new date before you paste then the event is automatically added to that day. In many apps you can even paste it in at the time you have selected.<\/li>\n<li>Fantastical on iOS gives you the option to duplicate an event when you tap and hold on it, or when you swipe, and tap \"More...\", BusyCal allows you to duplicate an event by force touching it.

            "content_text": " This week's episodes of The Automators is focused on calendar event creation. There are many ways you can automatically create calendar events, and it's useful to be able to do so, to avoid losing information. You can also use calendar events as a trigger to do something - which we cover towards the end. Below there are details of all the automations we cover, including 4 (really, four!) screencasts.\nWorkflow: Calendar Event Templates\n This is a very simple Workflow which asks me for the date and time of the event, and then what kind of event this is (the demo has 3 examples) - it then adjusts the time to add an appropriate length for the appointment and adds it to my calendar. This is very useful because I can never remember what floor my dentist is on or exactly where to turn to find my hairdresser - so I can add this to the notes. Even if the places you frequent are not hidden like mine are you can still use this!\nYou can get the workflow here: Calendar Event Templates Make sure to read on to find out about the \"Run Workflow\" action at the end of it.\nWorkflow: Add Event To Work Calendar\n This workflow follows the first one, and is in fact run by it - or could be. It simply asks you if the appointment you've made is during working hours, and if you say yes, adds an event that starts half an hour before and ends half an hour after the appointment you've just created to your calendar. Make sure to tweak the calendar setting here! You can get the workflow here: Add Event To Work Calendar (Menu)\nOf course, you can automate this too, this formats the date of the event as one letter (so Monday becomes M, Friday becomes F), and if it's not Saturday or Sunday, checks if the event starts after 8 am but before 6pm - if yes it adds an event to your calendar. It's not insanely complicated, but it's not as simple as the Workflow above.\nYou can get the workflow here: Add Event To Work Calendar (Auto)\nDavid's Hyper Scheduling Workflow\n Since February David has had an ongoing Hyper-Scheduling Experiment, which involves scheduling blocks of time in his calendar to provide a framework throughout his day. You can see his Workflow to generate some of the core blocks here.\n\n    \n\nYou can get the workflow here: Block Schedule\nAdd Travel Time\n Here David walks you through how his Workflow to add travel time events to your calendar works.\n\n    \n\nYou can get the workflow here: Travel Time\nRepeating Events\nOf course, one of the simplest ways to automate calendar event creation is repeats - and you can go from very simple up to fairly complex within that. The simplest repeats are every day\/week\/month\/year, but if you go into the Custom... options then you can create repeats such as \"On the first weekday of every month\".\n\n\n\nCopy and paste\nIf repeating events count as automation (they do!) then copying and pasting events does as well.\n\nCMD+D allows you to duplicate an event, and then you can drag and drop it.\nCMD+C and then CMD+V lets you paste, if you select a new date before you paste then the event is automatically added to that day. In many apps you can even paste it in at the time you have selected.\nFantastical on iOS gives you the option to duplicate an event when you tap and hold on it, or when you swipe, and tap \"More...\", BusyCal allows you to duplicate an event by force touching it. I personally prefer Fantastical as it immediately asks me for the new date where as with BusyCal you need to edit the new event.\n\n\n\nWorkflow: Copy a Calendar Event\n This Workflow lets you choose from calendar events, and uses the chosen item to create a new event. It is currently set to use events from today, but you can easily change the filter in the \"Find Calendar Events\" action to look in the last week, the next week, or any time period of your choice.\n\n    \n\n\nYou can get the workflow here: Copy Calendar Event\nParsing a list of events with Numbers\nI first mentioned this automation in episode 418 of the Mac Power Users, this is designed to help you take a list of events and quickly add them to the right calendars. As David mentioned on the podcast you could also use it to calculate dates backwards from a specific event (he used a trial as an example) to add other events or deadlines to your calendar.\n\n    \n\nYou can download the spreadsheet here.\nThe Keyboard Maestro Macro is very simple, it splits the text on your clipboard into lines, and then runs the following AppleScript on each line.\ntell application \"Keyboard Maestro Engine\" to set myEvent to getvariable \"Event\"\n\ntell application \"Fantastical 2\"\n    parse sentence myEvent with add immediately\nend tell\nThis AppleScript merely sets a local variable to the Keyboard Maestro variable for the line, and then uses Fantastical's AppleScript support to get it to parse the event and add it straight to your calendar. If you wanted to evaluate each event before it gets added then you would remove the with add immediately.\n\nYou can download this Keyboard Maestro Macro here\n You can also make this system iOS friendly in two ways, the Numbers sheet itself of course works on iOS. But you can do two things with the list of events it generates, the first is to use a Workflow, Clipboard Events To Fantastical which goes through all the lines on your clipboard adding them to Fantastical for you. The second way is to use Drafts, with the Events in Fantastical action provided by Agile Tortoise.\nAs mentioned in the show, David has a great series of video tutorials for Fantastical where he guides you through the core features and some of the syntax options.\nAdding event with AppleScript\nAs we mentioned in the show, AppleScript is not the most flexible when it comes to adding events to your calendar. However it is definitely possible! I highly recommend the official Apple documentation as a starting point for a script that works, There's also a library called CalendarLib which is linked on the very helpful macosautomation.com.\nOf course, you can also use AppleScript to control Fantastical - as demonstrated in my Keyboard Maestro Macro above, here's their documentation for integration with other apps.\nCloud Based Automation\nUsing web services like IFTTT or Zapier to automate things based on calendar events can be limited if you're not using the \"right\" calendar system - so you can have IFTTT trigger things based on an event starting in Google calendar, but not in iCloud calendar. You can however use a variety of triggers from time and date, to RSS feed entries, to add events to your calendar on almost any system - as long as if it's iCloud you have the IFTTT app installed.\nFavourite Workflows\nIn this last part of the show we talked about our two favourite automations related to calendars.\nDavid - Meeting Confirmation\n This workflow is really useful if you have meetings that you need to remind other people of, David actually has two - one for in person meetings, and one for scheduled calls. You can get them here:\n\nMeeting Confirmation\nPhone Confirmation\n\nRose - Workflow: Event Review\n I use this Workflow to help me review the events that have happened in the last week, as well as to prepare tasks for appointments in the upcoming week. This adds the calendar events from last week to a Drafts note, and combines any tasks you note down for the next week into Taskpaper and adds them to Omnifocus.\nYou can get the workflow here: Event Review",

            "content_html": "<p>I love my iPad, it's a great, very portable device that I can use for almost everything. Unfortunately the almost for most people is a deal breaker - but I'm stubborn and see these things as a problem to be solved rather than a reason to use another device!<\/p>\n<p>One of my most frequently used \"tools\" are servers - if you can call a server a tool. This blog runs on one, as does <a href=\"https:\/\/automationorchard.com\">Automation Orchard<\/a>, as well as a lot of little scripts which make my life easier. Unfortunately having an entire server running locally on an iPad isn't quite possible yet - apps like <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/id593757593?at=1010lumu\">DraftCode Offline PHP IDE<\/a> are fabulous and can even run Wordpress - but sometimes needs must, and you need something that is less restricted. This is where my Raspberry Pi Zero W comes into play.<\/p>\n<p><img title=\"My Raspberry Pi with a short Micro USB Cable and Anker Battery Pack\" alt=\"My Raspberry Pi with a short Micro USB Cable and Anker Battery Pack\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/8\/a\/a\/c\/6\/8aac67b56f53168cf5c70d95cce3b490f5577b52-pi-on-a-plane.jpeg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The Raspberry Pi Zero W, for those of you not familiar with it, is an extremely small headless computer - it doesn't have a screen - indeed when you buy it you just get the board, that's it! The hard drive is a micro SD card, and it sports a few ports - 2 micro USB (one for power), and a mini HDMI. How on earth can you connect to that with an iPad?<\/p>\n<p>The answer is not the shortest or easiest, but it does sound simple: wifi. I have set my Raspberry Pi up so that when it boots up it creates a wifi network, of course this doesn't create an internet connection, but that's not what we're after here. I won't go into the steps of setting this up here, instead I recommend you follow this guide: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.raspberrypi.org\/documentation\/configuration\/wireless\/access-point.md\">Setting Up a Raspberry Pi as an Access Point in a Standalone Network (NAT)<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The other part I needed to do was to make sure the Pi would always have the same IP address. This allows me to use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/blog\/remote-control-raspberry-pi\">use Workflow to control it via SSH<\/a>, and connect to it with <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/id500906297?at=1010lumu\">Coda<\/a> which lets me hook right into the device and has great syntax highlighting. As I mostly program for the web with PHP I use Coda in split screen with Safari which I can refresh to see the results of what I'm doing. <\/p>\n<p>I use a CMS called Grav, and they have a nice little guide to help you set up the <a href=\"https:\/\/getgrav.org\/blog\/raspberrypi-nginx-php7-dev\">Raspberry Pi<\/a> to run it - there are guides to set up most CMS on a Pi if you look.<\/p>\n<p>Why would I do all of this over using something like Linode or Digital Ocean, you might ask. It's a very simple answer: internet isn't always a given. I travel a lot, and most of my flights do not have wifi (and those that do charge a fortune for it). Even trains go through tunnels where you lose your connection. If you always have wifi or cellular data then you can avoid carrying a tiny computer, cable and battery pack along with your iPad, but if you don't then this is a very small combination that gives you a lot of power.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hardware in use:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/thepihut.com\/collections\/raspberry-pi-zero\/products\/raspberry-pi-zero-w\">Raspberry Pi Zero W<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/thepihut.com\/collections\/raspberry-pi-cases\/products\/pibow-zero-w\">Pibow Zero W<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B01CU1EC6Y\/?tag=rosemaryorchard-20\">Anker PowerCore<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B01NAMTC5T\/?tag=rosemaryorchard-20\">Anker PowerLine Micro USB (4 Inches)<\/a>\nYou'll also need a microSD card and to set up the OS on it, if you're not sure where to begin you can buy one with <a href=\"https:\/\/thepihut.com\/products\/noobs-preinstalled-sd-card\">NOOBS preinstalled<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>",
            "content_text": "I love my iPad, it's a great, very portable device that I can use for almost everything. Unfortunately the almost for most people is a deal breaker - but I'm stubborn and see these things as a problem to be solved rather than a reason to use another device!\nOne of my most frequently used \"tools\" are servers - if you can call a server a tool. This blog runs on one, as does Automation Orchard, as well as a lot of little scripts which make my life easier. Unfortunately having an entire server running locally on an iPad isn't quite possible yet - apps like DraftCode Offline PHP IDE are fabulous and can even run Wordpress - but sometimes needs must, and you need something that is less restricted. This is where my Raspberry Pi Zero W comes into play.\n\nThe Raspberry Pi Zero W, for those of you not familiar with it, is an extremely small headless computer - it doesn't have a screen - indeed when you buy it you just get the board, that's it! The hard drive is a micro SD card, and it sports a few ports - 2 micro USB (one for power), and a mini HDMI. How on earth can you connect to that with an iPad?\nThe answer is not the shortest or easiest, but it does sound simple: wifi. I have set my Raspberry Pi up so that when it boots up it creates a wifi network, of course this doesn't create an internet connection, but that's not what we're after here. I won't go into the steps of setting this up here, instead I recommend you follow this guide: Setting Up a Raspberry Pi as an Access Point in a Standalone Network (NAT)\nThe other part I needed to do was to make sure the Pi would always have the same IP address. This allows me to use use Workflow to control it via SSH, and connect to it with Coda which lets me hook right into the device and has great syntax highlighting. As I mostly program for the web with PHP I use Coda in split screen with Safari which I can refresh to see the results of what I'm doing. \nI use a CMS called Grav, and they have a nice little guide to help you set up the Raspberry Pi to run it - there are guides to set up most CMS on a Pi if you look.\nWhy would I do all of this over using something like Linode or Digital Ocean, you might ask. It's a very simple answer: internet isn't always a given. I travel a lot, and most of my flights do not have wifi (and those that do charge a fortune for it). Even trains go through tunnels where you lose your connection. If you always have wifi or cellular data then you can avoid carrying a tiny computer, cable and battery pack along with your iPad, but if you don't then this is a very small combination that gives you a lot of power.\nHardware in use:\n\nRaspberry Pi Zero W\nPibow Zero W\nAnker PowerCore\nAnker PowerLine Micro USB (4 Inches)\nYou'll also need a microSD card and to set up the OS on it, if you're not sure where to begin you can buy one with NOOBS preinstalled.\n",

As I prefer to use the search in DevonThink to find references I remember this isn't a problem, and I can also use the NEAR search parameter (<code>NEAR(man, cat)<\/code> would find items where the word man is within 10 words of the word cat, you can expand on this with <code>NEAR(man, cat, 100)<\/code> which would do the same but within 100 words - this is a massive timesaver for me.<\/p>\n<p><img title=\"Smart folder settings in Zotero to find attachments\" alt=\"Smart folder settings in Zotero to find attachments\" class=\"image-center\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/d\/5\/8\/4\/5\/d5845a6257eb0cf2329145ba0272ae7e77a5077d-zotero-smart-folder-settings-find-attachments.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Sometimes items added to Zotero do not always have the complete metadata - this tends to be my university website in my case.

The project will already exist as I have to register for the course, and potentially order course materials or communicate with the course professors before I get the syllabus.

We then go through every section inputting the name of it. If I know that the course is split into weeks then I modify this action in advance to just use \"Week <code>Repeat Index<\/code>\" as the name of the section. I use the start and end dates to set due and defer dates, and then select if this section is to study something or to submit something (study or assignment).

I came across a purple link watch strap on Reddit months ago, fell in love and then was immensely disappointed it had sold out.  I did spot the rainbow strap on the same website though, and immediately put it on my wish list. <\/p>\n<p>Since then the rainbow strap has been in the back of my mind - I dislike buckles on watches, which is why I never tried to get the <a href=\"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2017\/06\/05\/apple-releases-rainbow-pride-edition-apple-watch-band-new-nike-sport-colors-now-available-to-order-through-apple\u2024com\/\">Apple Pride strap<\/a> despite loving the idea and colour combination. Similarly, I've never owned a link strap for my Apple Watch. My wrists are small, so unless the strap comes with an adjuster tool, it often ends up being <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/microblog\/2018-04-17-1451\">comically large<\/a>. Juuk ships all of their watch straps with an adjuster tool, and the <a href=\"http:\/\/juukdesign.com\/faq\">video guides for adjustment<\/a> didn't look too hard to follow either - I decided to give it a whirl.<\/p>\n<p>I paid for fast shipping, and shipping was <strong>fast<\/strong>. I ordered May 1st; it was delivered May 5th. Of course, postage depends a lot on the postal services are involved and handover time - but it's safe to say I'm impressed. The watch was in an envelope, in a box - in a box. Good packaging so you could give the strap as a gift, and the recipient would be delighted. <\/p>\n<p><img title=\"Outer box, brown cardboard\" alt=\"Outer box, brown cardboard\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/1\/9\/e\/d\/8\/19ed8206494866de6bdbb1f3b0f24746a8a53539-outer-box.jpeg\" \/>\n<img title=\"Inner box, white with a picture of the strap on it and the Juuk logo at the top\" alt=\"Inner box, white with a picture of the strap on it and the Juuk logo at the top\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/6\/3\/7\/7\/3\/637737e54fb061c126da107387aa6610ab8dfe98-inner-box.jpeg\" \/>\n<img title=\"The strap in the box, in grey foam.

But being aluminium rather than steel it's not that heavy, making it comfortable to wear all day. Every link is a different colour graduating through the rainbow from the watch face on both sides, and it is designed so that one side has one more link than the other - to make it easier for you to put on and take off I presume, the idea being the shorter side brings the butterfly closure closer to the inside of your wrist. An extra nice touch is the last link above the closure has Juuk engraved into it, it't not highlighted in any colour and if you weren't looking for it you might miss it.

Finally you might want to check on my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/blog\/omnifocus-3-sneak-peak\">OmniFocus Sneak Peak<\/a> - though that was back in March and more than a few things have changed since then!<\/p>\n\n<h2>Multi-Pane Mode<\/h2>\n<p><a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/7\/2\/5\/8\/6\/7258675ccfc39e30730fd7350df9ab836eb75c27-3-pane-view.jpeg\"><img title=\"OmniFocus 3 Pane View, Sidebar, Outline (Forecast View) and Inspector\" alt=\"OmniFocus 3 Pane View, Sidebar, Outline (Forecast View) and Inspector\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/c\/0\/f\/8\/b\/c0f8bcd0ee042ccfbb1af50b091cc4a2ab5251f1-3-pane-view.jpeg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>My favourite feature has to be the multi pane view, being able to see 3 columns at once makes me happy, and it works exceptionally well on the 12.9\" iPad Pro. You can choose to pin the sidebar and the inspector independently of one another or together, so you can have a 2 pane view if that's what you need. The outline view is always shown on the iPad.<\/p>\n<h2>Tags<\/h2>\n<p>Tags, glorious tags. What used to be contexts has been renamed, and that opens up all sorts of possibilities. I've seen people experimenting with energy levels, I'm personally experimenting with \"time of day\" tags, and you can go as crazy as you like. Where tags are really paying off for me is being able to add both \"waiting on\" and \"Person A\" to a task - so whenever I check my agenda for \"Person A\" I see that I'm waiting on that task, as well as seeing it in my waiting on list.<\/p>\n<h2>Perspectives<\/h2>\n<p>Perspectives are where everything is different. All your perspectives have been migrated over from OmniFocus 2, and you can upgrade those to OmniFocus 3 perspectives which gives you the following options:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Status\n<ul>\n<li>Due Soon<\/li>\n<li>Flagged<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>Availability\n<ul>\n<li>First Available<\/li>\n<li>Available<\/li>\n<li>Remaining<\/li>\n<li>Completed<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>Has a due date<\/li>\n<li>Has a defer date<\/li>\n<li>Has an estimated duration<\/li>\n<li>Has an estimated duration less than\n<ul>\n<li>5 minutes<\/li>\n<li>15 minutes<\/li>\n<li>30 minutes<\/li>\n<li>60 minutes<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>Is untagged<\/li>\n<li>Has a tag which\n<ul>\n<li>Is active<\/li>\n<li>Is on hold<\/li>\n<li>Is dropped<\/li>\n<li>Is active and has available actions<\/li>\n<li>Is active and has no available actions<\/li>\n<li>Is tagged with any of<\/li>\n<li>Is tagged with all of<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>Is not a project or group<\/li>\n<li>Is in the inbox<\/li>\n<li>Has a project which\n<ul>\n<li>Is active or on hold  <\/li>\n<li>Is on hold<\/li>\n<li>Has been completed<\/li>\n<li>Has been dropped<\/li>\n<li>Is active and has available actions<\/li>\n<li>Is active and has no available actions<\/li>\n<li>Is active and has a future defer date<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>Is contained within a project or folder<\/li>\n<li>Matches search terms<\/li>\n<li>All of the following<\/li>\n<li>Any of the following<\/li>\n<li>None of the following<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The best part of perspectives is being able to add as many rules as you like. The top level is always \"All of the following\", and then you start adding rules within that. You can also add \"Any of the following\", \"None of the following\" and \"All of the following\" and add rules inside of those - useful for requiring a group of rules (e.g. flagged and has Tag X), or setting optional groups. I have a \"Now\" perspective which changes all the time, and I tap the rule above my Work folder to change it to \"All of the following\" to \"None of the following\" depending on if I'm at work or not.<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/1\/0\/4\/d\/1\/104d13736a1b11de2a49b19a3991019e932e9bf8-now-perspective.jpeg\"><img title=\"My now perspective\" alt=\"My now perspective\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/8\/0\/9\/5\/2\/809523b2b4105e962a4cbc3f82a66cd404471449-now-perspective.jpeg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Batch Editing<\/h2>\n<p>Being able to edit more than one task at once is not a feature I need frequently, but it is one I really appreciate when I use it. You can enable it by tapping the \"Edit\" button in the top right, and then selecting multiple tasks. You can access the task inspector in the batch edit mode, and it will show you all of the properties which are the same, and a greyed out option where they're different. If I selected two tasks, one had a due date of today and one with tomorrow, I could still set a new due date for both items at the same time though. You can also use CMD+A to select all the tasks in the current view if you have an external keyboard attached - very useful if your inbox was empty, you added a lot of tasks and then realised they should have been in a project instead!\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/5\/5\/f\/0\/b\/55f0bbb5af451c8934520975f1dfb2297da328aa-batch-editing.png\"><img title=\"Batch editing, 3 tasks selected in the outline with the inspector open\" alt=\"Batch editing, 3 tasks selected in the outline with the inspector open\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/2\/1\/a\/f\/4\/21af4f190bf8cb2cf161eaff99e0e166a6f92a02-batch-editing.png\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Custom Repeats<\/h2>\n<p>I love repeating tasks, my problem is my repeating tasks aren't all that regular (at least most of them), thankfully I can handle this in OmniFocus 3. You can set repeats with an hourly, daily, weekly or monthly interval, but you can also say \"every Tuesday and Saturday\", or \"the first Wednesday of every month\", or \"the last day of every month\".

In the main settings you can specify notifications for due dates and defer dates globally, and these can also be enabled or removed on each task. You are also able to set two extra kinds of notifications - ones relative to the due date, and ones at a specific date and time. These reminders are a great help with those crucial tasks - if you need someone with a hazmat suit though you're on your own.\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/3\/c\/8\/5\/4\/3c85450ec79d94bdb6b1b03711d8f77571b62e77-notifications.png\"><img title=\"Adding extra notifications relative to the due date and at specific times\" alt=\"Adding extra notifications relative to the due date and at specific times\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/c\/a\/c\/2\/5\/cac25f3a4049eae6223a96db66e9da42f6562ad3-notifications.png\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Customisable Inspector<\/h2>\n<p>Some people love defer dates, some people hate them. Some people don't want notifications or repeats, for others those are on every task.

Instead of the gantt chart style event display in in OF2 (which at least for me wasn't very helpful), they are nice big blocks which show which calendar they're on, when they start and when they end. If you have a meeting 9am-10am, and then a due date at 10:30 that's the order you'll see your tasks in.<\/p>\n<h3>Forecast Tag<\/h3>\n<p>You can now choose a task to display in the forecast view, this is ideal for things like routine tasks, a sprint at work (a series of tasks or projects to be completed within a specific time period), or errands. You can choose different forecast tags per device, so on your iPhone you might choose calls or errands, but on your iPad it could be \"secret nerdy tasks\".<\/p>\n\n<p>There are a lot of big changes in OmniFocus 3, and based on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.omnigroup.com\/blog\/omni-roadmap-2018#omnifocus3\">roadmap<\/a> there will be a lot more to come, but first of all we have WWDC and the Mac app to look forward to!<\/p>",

In OmniFocus 3 you can choose which properties you want to see by default in the inspector - just open up a task, tag or project and tap \"Customize Inspector\" at the bottom to move the items you want to where you want them to bo.\n\nForecast\nThe forecast has changed a lot in OmniFocus 3, there are two major changes which I'll look at here.\n\nInterleaved Events &amp; Due Items\n\nCalendar events are interleaved with due items in your day. Instead of the gantt chart style event display in in OF2 (which at least for me wasn't very helpful), they are nice big blocks which show which calendar they're on, when they start and when they end. If you have a meeting 9am-10am, and then a due date at 10:30 that's the order you'll see your tasks in.\nForecast Tag\nYou can now choose a task to display in the forecast view, this is ideal for things like routine tasks, a sprint at work (a series of tasks or projects to be completed within a specific time period), or errands. You can choose different forecast tags per device, so on your iPhone you might choose calls or errands, but on your iPad it could be \"secret nerdy tasks\".\n\nThere are a lot of big changes in OmniFocus 3, and based on the roadmap there will be a lot more to come, but first of all we have WWDC and the Mac app to look forward to!",

            "content_text": "Trello is a lovely service which offers Kanban boards for planning - and I often like to plan out projects there, especially ones that need to be done in multiple stages or have many areas of focus. OmniFocus is my task manager of choice though which means I need my tasks to end up in there to have any hope of accomplishing them. To this end I have created a few Workflow workflows to get the data out of Trello and into OmniFocus, they\u2019re not very sophisticated - but they function very well.\nSingle Trello List to OmniFocus\n Maybe you just have one list in Trello and you want to get the tasks and put them in OmniFocus. This workflow does exactly that. \nSteps: \n\n Get Trello Items:  This gets all of your Trello boards.\n Choose from List: You choose the board you want to get data from.\n Get Trello Items: Then we get all of the lists in the board you just chose.\n Choose from List: Now you choose which list you want to grab the cards from.\n Get Trello Items: We get all of the cards.\n Repeat with Each: We go through each card.\n\n Text: We format the title and the description of the card to be the name of the text and the note (in TaskPaper format notes are indented on a new line after their task).\n\n Combine Text: We put all of the cards together.\n Add TaskPaper to OmniFocus: The data gets added to OmniFocus.\n\nYou can get the workflow here: Trello List To OmniFocus\nMultiple Trello Lists to OmniFocus\n If you have several lists on a board you want to get into OmniFocus then this Workflow will allow you to do that. It will create a task or action group for each list with sub tasks for each card in that list in Trello.\nSteps: \n\n Get Trello Items: Get your Trello boards here.\n Choose from List: Choose the Trello board you want to get the lists from.\n Get Trello Items: Get the lists.\n Choose from List: Choose one or many lists\n Repeat with Each: With each list\n\n Set Variable: Set the list variable to be the name of the list. Working with multiple repeats can get a bit tricky, hence not using the Repeat Item variables here.\n Get Trello Items: Get the cards\n Repeat with Each: For every card\n\n Set Variable: Set the card variable to be the card.\n Get Details of Trello Item: Get the name of the Trello card.\n Get Variable: Get the card variable back.\n Get Details of Trello Item: Get the description of the Trello card\n Text: Format this in TaskPaper format.\n\n Combine Text: Put all of the TaskPaper together\n Text: Add the name of the list to the top of this TaskPaper format\n\n Combine Text: Put all of the lists of TaskPaper tasks together.\n Add TaskPaper to OmniFocus: Put it all into OmniFocus.\n\nYou can get the workflow here: Multiple Trello Lists To OmniFocus\nTrello Board to OmniFocus\n If you have planned your whole project in Trello and want to move it over to OmniFocus then this Workflow will help you do so.

This is the last but one action in the action group - the reasoning being you're not likely to need it as often as some of the others! It simply opens a new Drafts with the format set to taskpaper - you can do this yourself by tapping the <code>+<\/code> icon if you're in a Draft, and then using the <code>Aa<\/code> button to set the <em>Syntax Highlighting<\/em> of the current draft to Taskpaper.<\/p>\n<p>The first action in the group is a tab, this is for iPhone users and iPad users without an external keyboard and it simply inserts a tab wherever the cursor currently is. <\/p>\n<p>The next action is Placeholder, if you have text selected it will wrap the text in <code>\u00ab\u00bb<\/code> characters, and if no text is selected it will insert them. This is ideal for dates in templates you will want to update later.<\/p>\n<p>The first Due action takes advantage of the natural language parsing that OmniFocus has available via URL Scheme. Again, if you have text selected it will wrap it in <code>@due()<\/code>, otherwise that will be inserted empty for you to fill in the brackets. <\/p>\n<p>The Defer, Estimate, Tags, and Context actions work the same way as Due. Tags and context are both available so if you're on the OmniFocus 3 beta or simply want to prepare your templates to work for both 2 and 3 you can already.<\/p>\n<p>Tags (suggest) offers a list of tags for you to choose from, allows you to choose more than one of them, and inserts them inside <code>@tag()<\/code>. You will need to edit this script to make it work for you - the <code>\"one\", \"two\", \"three\"<\/code> is the part that needs changing. Bear in mind that a long list of tags will be annoying to look through most likely. If you want any tags to be pre-selected for you (e.g. you usually add the <code>evening<\/code> tag to tasks created via Drafts), you can put that into the <code>[]<\/code> after the tag list. <\/p>\n<p><img title=\"Tag suggest script detail\" alt=\"Tag suggest script detail\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/d\/1\/6\/f\/a\/d16fa00d849b469e105afabe4fc7d4e7b5b194ab-tag-suggest-action-detail.jpeg\" \/>;<\/p>\n<p>Autodone asks you if you want the task or project to be automatically completed when the tasks inside of it are completed and inserts <code>@autodone(true)<\/code> or <code>@autodone(false)<\/code>as per your choice.<\/p>\n<p>The Repeat Method allows you to choose how the task should repeat, and inserts <code>@repeat-method(fixed)<\/code>, or whichever the relevant choice is.<\/p>\n<p>The Repeat Rule is very simple, but allows you to choose if a task should be repeated every X days, weeks, months, or years.<\/p>\n<p>Parallel works the same way Autodone does, if the project should be parallel (actions able to be worked on at the same time) then <code>@parallel(true)<\/code> is inserted, if not <code>@parallel(false)<\/code> appears.<\/p>\n<p>Flagged just inserts <code>@flagged<\/code> when it is run - which adds a flag to a task.<\/p>\n<p>Due and Defer are here again - but this time with date and time pickers. This allows you to choose an exact date and time when your task or project is due. I've used European date formatting, but you can modify that to any other date formatting by replacing the <code>\"dd-MM-yyyy hh:mm\"<\/code> (for example in North America you might prefer <code>\"MM\/dd\/yyyy hh:mm\"<\/code>).<\/p>\n<p>Estimate makes another appearance, this time it asks you to choose how many minutes, hours, days or weeks something will take and fills in the <code>@estimate()<\/code> for you.<\/p>\n<p>The final action in this set is Taskpaper to OF. This will ask you where you want to save your Draft (as a new project, a new project in a folder, as tasks in a specifc project, or the inbox), go through any <code>\u00abplaceholders\u00bb<\/code> you have and help you replace them (important <code>cat<\/code> is always going to be replaced with whatever you tell the script when it asks you about it, so make sure you to use unique placeholders where necessary!), and then send everything off to OmniFocus. Once you return if it did have placeholders to replace it offers to make a new Draft, update your current Draft, or do nothing. <\/p>\n<p>This action group is set up as a keyboard group, which should make quick entry easier.

Why? Sometimes that message turns into an email, or maybe the quick idea turns into a mind map. Or maybe you just don\u2019t know where the text is going to end up when you start writing. Drafts is designed to let you write and then process the text, removing the need to choose where the text should go first.  <\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/a\/7\/2\/5\/e\/a725e094e1073b80605b380cb8eb80673c82409f-drafts5-main-views.png\"><img title=\"Drafts 5 Main Views\" alt=\"Drafts 5 Main Views\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/b\/5\/7\/3\/6\/b5736f1b971e0991bc88a9251143588fb251b08a-drafts5-main-views.png\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>When you open Drafts you get a blank note - automatically. You can set the time out period so that when you return to Drafts you either see your last note or a new note - mine is set to the default of 60 seconds. You can also open the app with force touch which allows you to create a new blank note, create a note from the clipboard, dictate a note, search, or open any one of your 4 most recently edited Drafts. The first three of these options, plus the choice to import a file, appear when you force touch the <code>+<\/code> on an iPhone, or press and hold on an iPad. The great part about the dictation is that unlike regular Siri dictation there\u2019s no timeout, that\u2019s right - you can dictate for as long as you like. David Sparks made a great introduction to Drafts 5 which I highly recommend: <a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/263943764\">Drafts 5 Overview<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/9\/1\/8\/0\/c\/9180c800c35453eb9788bf814df6abbbfa218b0a-drafts5-force-touch-icon.jpeg\"><img title=\"Force Touch Options\" alt=\"Force Touch Options\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/0\/0\/6\/8\/a\/0068ac0a3ff4e418562d1d59f332502ffa21b844-drafts5-force-touch-icon.jpeg\" \/><\/a>\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/b\/1\/d\/3\/2\/b1d325c339f72c1f34078317ecc276731b900eb8-drafts5-new-drafts-options.jpeg\"><img title=\"New Draft Creation Options\" alt=\"New Draft Creation Options\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/1\/f\/1\/5\/c\/1f15c907fc170384719069eeda4824638d4d44ec-drafts5-new-drafts-options.jpeg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>What Changed?<\/h3>\n<p>Some of you may have used Drafts before, in fact if you\u2019re reading this it\u2019s likely you have so what\u2019s new? First of all the app has been completely rewritten, this means everything is new and shiny - and 100% up to date.  There's also lots of new features.<\/p>\n<p>First things first, you can import all of your notes to Drafts and most of your actions. Make sure you're running the latest version of Drafts 4, and then in the settings of Drafts 5, tap \"Migrate from Drafts 4\". You can choose to import your Drafts, and\/or Actions and Keys. You can also export from Drafts 4 into Drafts 5 - there's a special <a href=\"http:\/\/drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com\/a\/2Nv\">Send to Drafts 5<\/a> for drafts, and inside each action in Drafts 4 you can choose to migrate the action, or add it as a callback so when the action is executed it is done so in Drafts 4 and then returns you to Drafts 5. Not every action which was available in Drafts 4 is available yet in Drafts 5, but Drafts 5 will make a list of the actions that couldn't be imported so you can handle those manually.<\/p>\n<h4>Themes<\/h4>\n<p>Drafts 4 had three theme choices - white, cream and black - and the ability to automatically switch to the black theme at a certain brightness threshold. Drafts 5 has several more colour theme options, and you can specify a day theme and a night theme to work with, which will switch at the brightness level you prefer. Choose the theme is a pro feature, and I've really enjoyed using the dark Solarized theme during the day with black at night.  <\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/b\/9\/8\/f\/3\/b98f3f439b1b16e6b1ce8f4512d2b1e0d4825ac3-drafts5-theme-options.jpeg\"><img title=\"Theme Options\" alt=\"Theme Options\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/5\/7\/3\/a\/3\/573a39f96e89a155dc6bbf036a7cbaeaddbdf5a1-drafts5-theme-options.jpeg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Custom Icons<\/h4>\n<p>Choosing app icons is definitely a nice way to make your device yours, and Drafts now offers the ability to choose your app icon. There's a mix of flat images and ones with gradients - I personally picked the purple as that's my favourite colour.<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/4\/e\/7\/3\/0\/4e730487a3dcb22f12982792bbf5288f7d7dcf8b-drafts5-app-icons.png\"><img title=\"App Icons\" alt=\"App Icons\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/6\/a\/1\/f\/5\/6a1f5aca8cf4b129bc919007df9cf8e165180619-drafts5-app-icons.png\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Tagging and Flagging<\/h4>\n<p>Tagging allows you to optionally file your note in multiple places - and helps you to group together notes on a particular topic as well. Tags are shown under a draft in the list of drafts. When adding a tag to a draft you can see a list of your current tags in the keyboard bar, if the one you are looking for doesn't exist then you can type to create it. Tags are lower case - you can type capitals when creating them but they will be formatted for you. This is really useful as it allows you to avoid having <code>Groceries<\/code> and <code>groceries<\/code> by accident.\nFlagging is simple - a draft is flagged, or it is not flagged. You can use it however makes the most sense to you.<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/3\/a\/4\/2\/6\/3a426d1a05007ba58947885773f6080796e57f54-drafts5-flagging-tagging-a-draft.jpeg\"><img title=\"Flagging and Tagging a Draft\" alt=\"Flagging and Tagging a Draft\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/8\/f\/7\/b\/7\/8f7b7b2fb0c91ebd0e75ca709e6af3ee2e6809fa-drafts5-flagging-tagging-a-draft.jpeg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Filtering<\/h4>\n<p>Now we have filters we need to be able to work with them. Filtering allows us to choose combinations of tags to see or not as we want. By tapping the name of a tag in the filter section we add it to include, and by tapping the <i class=\"fas fa-ban\"><\/i> (ban) icon we can add the tag to the omitted list. This means you could include the tags <code>cat<\/code> and <code>dog<\/code>, but disallow <code>spider<\/code>. These tags are combined with an <code>AND<\/code>, so only drafts with <em>all<\/em> of the included tags and <em>none<\/em> of the omitted tags will show up.\nTags are not the only settings however, you can also set how much of a draft you want to see in the list, the sort order, if flagged items should be included or not, specific text to search for and more. <\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/c\/d\/6\/4\/0\/cd64074e336e7f4f573be1291dfdddfc917708ed-drafts5-filters.jpeg\"><img title=\"Filters\" alt=\"Filters\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/1\/3\/7\/0\/7\/13707a25ec2dfb2e6fc9683751704fda84571363-drafts5-filters.jpeg\" \/><\/a>\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/d\/4\/2\/a\/2\/d42a26d7427e0ac0ff249d7bbfa37fe361a8fad6-drafts5-workspace-options.jpeg\"><img title=\"Filter & Workspace Options\" alt=\"Filter & Workspace Options\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/6\/f\/5\/7\/9\/6f579ae1eb693a942203f0c1f41a6bfabe867c82-drafts5-workspace-options.jpeg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The full documentation for <a href=\"http:\/\/getdrafts.com\/drafts\/listoptions\">filtering in Drafts<\/a> is well worth reading.<\/p>\n<h4>Workspaces<\/h4>\n<p>Workspaces can be created in two ways, from a filter you are currently using, or from scratch. They have the same set up as filters, but as you can name them and set the colour and icon to represent they are easy to keep track of. You can set the order that you would like to view your Workspaces in, and optionally show them, with or without  their name, at the bottom of the list of Drafts. Workspaces are ideal for filters you make frequently, or which are more complex to construct.<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/6\/6\/8\/2\/6\/66826a0dcab2870b4be18929dd7de5909129bdcd-drafts5-workspaces-overview.jpeg\"><img title=\"Workspaces Overview\" alt=\"Workspaces Overview\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/d\/0\/2\/e\/b\/d02eb6bdff57fe8c84535b022a8fc4636987f58a-drafts5-workspaces-overview.jpeg\" \/><\/a>\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/9\/9\/1\/5\/4\/99154e9338695db3fe837574bf0823aefcf8b58f-drafts5-workspaces-below-draft-list.jpeg\"><img title=\"Show Workspaces Below Drafts List\" alt=\"Show Workspaces Below Drafts List\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/2\/b\/d\/1\/b\/2bd1b66441c99d1d3c8a6917a546c9ad49a93119-drafts5-workspaces-below-draft-list.jpeg\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/6\/4\/9\/3\/d\/6493d441f97034f482873c4464756a7d57c12116-drafts5-untagged-workspace.jpeg\"><img title=\"Untagged Workspace\" alt=\"Untagged Workspace\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/a\/5\/e\/7\/6\/a5e76e7eeca9a82543c30c1df07a7343c37b7076-drafts5-untagged-workspace.jpeg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Focus<\/h4>\n<p>By default Drafts will open to a new draft after a set period of time - which can be adjusted by you. Focus mode allows you to do that by focusing on one particular draft, this means that whenever you open the app - even if that's next month - you'll be back at the draft you had open last. You can enable focus mode in two ways, by tapping the eye icon in the bottom left hand side of the editor when you're not editing a draft, or by opening the Settings and enabling it.<\/p>\n<h4>SiriKit Integration<\/h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hey Siri, make a note in Drafts to investigate buying the llama farm  <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>You can now create new Drafts using Siri, it's simple but effective.

As you can assign keyboard shortcuts to actions as well this becomes very powerful very quickly.<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/9\/c\/d\/d\/d\/9cddd6d90193a4a5b0487f8689f398fd3d1f9289-drafts5-action-steps.png\"><img title=\"Action Steps\" alt=\"Action Steps\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/2\/0\/b\/e\/c\/20beceb7298f679088a423d744af09a2411930c6-drafts5-action-steps.png\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Scripting in Drafts<\/h4>\n<p>The most powerful part of Drafts actions is the Script action, this is what it sounds like - you write a script which does things. Drafts uses JavaScript, if you use OmniGroup products they are introducing JavaScript for automation in those too - so learning the language could definitely pay off in the long run.\nThere is <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/agiletortoise\/drafts-documentation\/wiki\">a wiki about Drafts scripting<\/a>, which is definitely worth reading if you intend to use them.\nMy favourite functions that can be included in Scripting is the Prompt - so if you want to ask the user \"cats or dogs\", you could create a prompt which shows \"cats\" and \"dogs\" as buttons, and then depending on which they choose your script would react accordingly. A prompt can have any of the following options<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Title<\/li>\n<li>Message<\/li>\n<li>Text Fields<\/li>\n<li>Date and or Time Fields<\/li>\n<li>Selects - single or multiple choice<\/li>\n<li>Buttons<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/4\/4\/c\/3\/9\/44c39216a677ef991e15935d5d7b28cd7606772a-drafts5-script-prompt.jpeg\"><img title=\"Scripted Prompt Example\" alt=\"Scripted Prompt Example\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/b\/f\/8\/0\/e\/bf80ec529ac89a6c4df996f17b93f96b1ca8585d-drafts5-script-prompt.jpeg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here's the script to create that prompt:<\/p>\n<pre><code>var p = Prompt.create();\n\np.title = \"Title\";\np.message = \"Message\";\n\np.addTextField(\"myTextField\", \"Text Field\", \"\");\np.addDatePicker(\"myDate\", \"Date Field\", new Date(), {\n  \"mode\": \"date\"\n});\np.addDatePicker(\"myTime\", \"Time Field\", new Date(), {\n  \"mode\": \"time\"\n});\np.addDatePicker(\"myDateTime\", \"Date &amp; Time Field\", new Date(), {\n  \"mode\": \"dateAndTime\"\n});\np.addSelect(\"mySingleSelect\", \"Single Select Field\", [\"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"Llama\"], [], false);\np.addSelect(\"myMultipleSelect\", \"Multiple Select Field\", [\"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"Llama\"], [], true);\np.addButton(\"Button\");\n\np.show();<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>The cancel button is in a prompt by default, but you can hide it if you wish. The prompt will definitely make an appearance in actions you import from the action directory - if only because it's a great way to get credentials from you which can be used in an action.<\/p>\n<h4>Credentials<\/h4>\n<p>If you want to Tweet with Drafts, save something to Evernote, or add tasks to Todoist, there are two ways to do that. Passing the data to the app on your device and telling it what to do - which is not possible with every app - or by using the API of the service to complete the action. The difficulty with an API is you need a token to access it - similar to needing a username and password to log in. Drafts 5 has a clever way to store these, so that scripts can access them without needing to save the access key in the script itself - so there's no worry that by sharing your Todoist action people can start adding things to <em>your<\/em> Todoist, unless you explicitly want them to do so and share your credential! You can change the credentials saved in Drafts by tapping on the Settings wheel in the bottom right of the editor, and opening Credentials. By choosing the \"forget\" option the credential is deleted, and you can input a new one the next time you run an action that needs it. This system is especially useful as you can share one credential with many scripts - so it doesn't matter if you have 1 or 100 Todoist scripts, they can all access the same key, and you are in charge of it. The <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/agiletortoise\/drafts-documentation\/wiki\/Credential\">documentation for credentials in scripts<\/a> is definitely worth reading if you want to access APIs, and the <a href=\"http:\/\/getdrafts.com\/settings\/credentials\">general documentation<\/a>  is also very helpful - especially if you have multiple accounts you want to interact with.<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/8\/a\/a\/7\/8\/8aa78459f9fb824119df5880a43b2c9ba6f6a349-drafts5-credentials.jpeg\"><img title=\"Credentials\" alt=\"Credentials\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rosemaryorchard.com\/images\/d\/9\/1\/2\/0\/d9120a6ec07b3142009bffeadedc50ed1bc975a0-drafts5-credentials.jpeg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>\u00a0Price<\/h4>\n<p>Drafts 5 is free.

            "content_text": "[TOC]\nIntro\n For those of you not familiar with Drafts, it\u2019s designed as an app which lets you input text and then decide what to do with it. Why? Sometimes that message turns into an email, or maybe the quick idea turns into a mind map. Or maybe you just don\u2019t know where the text is going to end up when you start writing. Drafts is designed to let you write and then process the text, removing the need to choose where the text should go first.  \n\nWhen you open Drafts you get a blank note - automatically. You can set the time out period so that when you return to Drafts you either see your last note or a new note - mine is set to the default of 60 seconds. You can also open the app with force touch which allows you to create a new blank note, create a note from the clipboard, dictate a note, search, or open any one of your 4 most recently edited Drafts. The first three of these options, plus the choice to import a file, appear when you force touch the + on an iPhone, or press and hold on an iPad. The great part about the dictation is that unlike regular Siri dictation there\u2019s no timeout, that\u2019s right - you can dictate for as long as you like. David Sparks made a great introduction to Drafts 5 which I highly recommend: Drafts 5 Overview\n\n\nWhat Changed?\nSome of you may have used Drafts before, in fact if you\u2019re reading this it\u2019s likely you have so what\u2019s new? First of all the app has been completely rewritten, this means everything is new and shiny - and 100% up to date.  There's also lots of new features.\nFirst things first, you can import all of your notes to Drafts and most of your actions. Make sure you're running the latest version of Drafts 4, and then in the settings of Drafts 5, tap \"Migrate from Drafts 4\". You can choose to import your Drafts, and\/or Actions and Keys. You can also export from Drafts 4 into Drafts 5 - there's a special Send to Drafts 5 for drafts, and inside each action in Drafts 4 you can choose to migrate the action, or add it as a callback so when the action is executed it is done so in Drafts 4 and then returns you to Drafts 5. Not every action which was available in Drafts 4 is available yet in Drafts 5, but Drafts 5 will make a list of the actions that couldn't be imported so you can handle those manually.\nThemes\nDrafts 4 had three theme choices - white, cream and black - and the ability to automatically switch to the black theme at a certain brightness threshold. Drafts 5 has several more colour theme options, and you can specify a day theme and a night theme to work with, which will switch at the brightness level you prefer. Choose the theme is a pro feature, and I've really enjoyed using the dark Solarized theme during the day with black at night.  \n\nCustom Icons\nChoosing app icons is definitely a nice way to make your device yours, and Drafts now offers the ability to choose your app icon. There's a mix of flat images and ones with gradients - I personally picked the purple as that's my favourite colour.\n\nTagging and Flagging\nTagging allows you to optionally file your note in multiple places - and helps you to group together notes on a particular topic as well. Tags are shown under a draft in the list of drafts. When adding a tag to a draft you can see a list of your current tags in the keyboard bar, if the one you are looking for doesn't exist then you can type to create it. Tags are lower case - you can type capitals when creating them but they will be formatted for you. This is really useful as it allows you to avoid having Groceries and groceries by accident.\nFlagging is simple - a draft is flagged, or it is not flagged. You can use it however makes the most sense to you.\n\nFiltering\nNow we have filters we need to be able to work with them. Filtering allows us to choose combinations of tags to see or not as we want. By tapping the name of a tag in the filter section we add it to include, and by tapping the  (ban) icon we can add the tag to the omitted list. This means you could include the tags cat and dog, but disallow spider. These tags are combined with an AND, so only drafts with all of the included tags and none of the omitted tags will show up.\nTags are not the only settings however, you can also set how much of a draft you want to see in the list, the sort order, if flagged items should be included or not, specific text to search for and more. \n\n\nThe full documentation for filtering in Drafts is well worth reading.\nWorkspaces\nWorkspaces can be created in two ways, from a filter you are currently using, or from scratch. They have the same set up as filters, but as you can name them and set the colour and icon to represent they are easy to keep track of. You can set the order that you would like to view your Workspaces in, and optionally show them, with or without  their name, at the bottom of the list of Drafts. Workspaces are ideal for filters you make frequently, or which are more complex to construct.\n\n\n\nFocus\nBy default Drafts will open to a new draft after a set period of time - which can be adjusted by you. Focus mode allows you to do that by focusing on one particular draft, this means that whenever you open the app - even if that's next month - you'll be back at the draft you had open last. You can enable focus mode in two ways, by tapping the eye icon in the bottom left hand side of the editor when you're not editing a draft, or by opening the Settings and enabling it.\nSiriKit Integration\n\nHey Siri, make a note in Drafts to investigate buying the llama farm  \n\nYou can now create new Drafts using Siri, it's simple but effective. You can also dictate notes, but that's not new - what's very useful though is that the dictation will not end as it does usually when dictating elsewhere on iOS.\n\nEditor Options\nIn Drafts you can now control a lot of settings with regards to how the editor appears, from paragraph numbers to syntax highlighting, and even whether or not the toolbar or the status bar should show you have plenty of choices. \n\n\n\nHere are some of the options you can choose to set for the editor by tapping the Aa button:\n\nSyntax highlighting\n\nPlain text\nMarkdown\nSimple List\nTaskpaper\nJavaScript\n\nFont\n\nChoose from any of the fonts pre-installed on iOS, or ones you have installed yourself.\nSelect a particular font to use for Monospaced text.\n\nLine height\nParagraph spacing\nMargins\nParagraph numbers\nYou can enable or disable\n\nAutocorrect\nSpell check\nSmart punctuation\n\nQuotes\nDashes\n\nCapitalisation\n\nNone or sentences\n\n\nPortrait, landscape, or any (only on iPhone)\n\nDraft 5 also has an improved arrange mode, Drafts 4 just allowed you to rearrange lines, Drafts 5 lets you edit blocks (separated by two line breaks) or lines, edit sections, and delete or remove them. You can also trigger the arrange mode via the URL scheme. \nThere is also a pre-installed Tasks action, which is shown on your keyboard by default. This is very clever, it makes the line that you're on or the text you have selected into a simple bullet checklist by adding - [ ] at the beginning of the line. By tapping on the [ ] you can mark a task as done [x].\n\u00a0Actions and Keyboard Groups\nFor those of you familiar with Workflow, actions are very similar in some ways. An action can contain any number of steps, a number of which are provided for you to use as is. Drafts does not arrive empty, it comes with 5 example action groups, 4 of which are available as keyboard groups for you - you can do what you like with these actions, including delete them. But if you're not familiar with Drafts and it's actions I recommend you swipe across the action from left to write, tap edit, and have a look.\nOne important change between Drafts 4 and Drafts 5 is there is no longer an app wide default as to what to do once an action has been executed, you now set this per action group. This is very useful so if you have a group of \"share\" actions for example, designed to get the text out of Drafts, you could immediately have the draft the action was executed on archived or trashed as you prefer.\nYou can choose to enable an action group on the keyboard, Draft has a row of buttons above the keyboard, and if you have multiple groups of keyboard actions you can swipe up and down on this row to switch between them. As you can assign keyboard shortcuts to actions as well this becomes very powerful very quickly.\n\nScripting in Drafts\nThe most powerful part of Drafts actions is the Script action, this is what it sounds like - you write a script which does things. Drafts uses JavaScript, if you use OmniGroup products they are introducing JavaScript for automation in those too - so learning the language could definitely pay off in the long run.\nThere is a wiki about Drafts scripting, which is definitely worth reading if you intend to use them.\nMy favourite functions that can be included in Scripting is the Prompt - so if you want to ask the user \"cats or dogs\", you could create a prompt which shows \"cats\" and \"dogs\" as buttons, and then depending on which they choose your script would react accordingly. A prompt can have any of the following options\n\nTitle\nMessage\nText Fields\nDate and or Time Fields\nSelects - single or multiple choice\nButtons\n\n\nHere's the script to create that prompt:\nvar p = Prompt.create();\n\np.title = \"Title\";\np.message = \"Message\";\n\np.addTextField(\"myTextField\", \"Text Field\", \"\");\np.addDatePicker(\"myDate\", \"Date Field\", new Date(), {\n  \"mode\": \"date\"\n});\np.addDatePicker(\"myTime\", \"Time Field\", new Date(), {\n  \"mode\": \"time\"\n});\np.addDatePicker(\"myDateTime\", \"Date &amp; Time Field\", new Date(), {\n  \"mode\": \"dateAndTime\"\n});\np.addSelect(\"mySingleSelect\", \"Single Select Field\", [\"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"Llama\"], [], false);\np.addSelect(\"myMultipleSelect\", \"Multiple Select Field\", [\"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"Llama\"], [], true);\np.addButton(\"Button\");\n\np.show();\nThe cancel button is in a prompt by default, but you can hide it if you wish. The prompt will definitely make an appearance in actions you import from the action directory - if only because it's a great way to get credentials from you which can be used in an action.\nCredentials\nIf you want to Tweet with Drafts, save something to Evernote, or add tasks to Todoist, there are two ways to do that. Passing the data to the app on your device and telling it what to do - which is not possible with every app - or by using the API of the service to complete the action. The difficulty with an API is you need a token to access it - similar to needing a username and password to log in. Drafts 5 has a clever way to store these, so that scripts can access them without needing to save the access key in the script itself - so there's no worry that by sharing your Todoist action people can start adding things to your Todoist, unless you explicitly want them to do so and share your credential! You can change the credentials saved in Drafts by tapping on the Settings wheel in the bottom right of the editor, and opening Credentials. By choosing the \"forget\" option the credential is deleted, and you can input a new one the next time you run an action that needs it. This system is especially useful as you can share one credential with many scripts - so it doesn't matter if you have 1 or 100 Todoist scripts, they can all access the same key, and you are in charge of it. The documentation for credentials in scripts is definitely worth reading if you want to access APIs, and the general documentation  is also very helpful - especially if you have multiple accounts you want to interact with.\n\n\u00a0Price\nDrafts 5 is free. Yes, you read that correctly. For the basic functionality you can get the app for free. If you want to create and edit your own actions, choose your theme(s) and custom icon, use Workspaces, have access to enhanced URL automation and support development you can do so for $1.99 a month, or $19.99 a year. If you're not sure which you need then there is a 7 day trial to let you play with the pro features.\nDavid Sparks (MacSparky) made a second video for Agile Tortoise showing what's new in version 5: Drafts 5: What's New\nUpgraded  and Awesome Things\nThat's a brief overview of the new things, now onto everything else!\nWidgets\nDrafts 4 had a widget, which allowed quick entry by default and if you enabled \"Show More\" (on the top right) allowed you to see the most recent Drafts. Drafts 5 has 3 widgets - one for quick entry, one for your recent items, and one for your workspaces. This allows you to enable and disable the ones you want on different devices, and with the workspaces go straight to the collection of Drafts you need. \n\n\n\nBackup and Export\nYour data is important, and there are backup options in Drafts which allow you to backup your drafts themselves, and\/or your actions. These options were there before, but are now unified onto one screen. You can also export your drafts with the option to add a filter - so you could export all of your Drafts with the tag \"cake recipe\" if you wanted - for example to send them to me.\n\n\nReminders Import\nReminders import was present in version 4 too, but now you can add a tag when the reminders are imported - which is very helpful for filtering for them later.\n\nAfter Action Success\nThis setting used to be global which could be overridden on a per action basis. You can now set this option for each action group, and you can still override it for an action if you wish. This is extremely helpful for the keyboard action groups as you're unlikely to want most of those actions to archive or trash your Draft when use them. \nDrafts Forums\nAgile Tortoise have set up forums where Drafts users can talk to one another, help each other create actions, request features, and more - I've already signed up and am checking it regularly to see what I can learn from everywhere else. \nDrafts Forums\nConclusion\nI've been using Drafts 5 instead of Drafts 4 for quite some time now, and I'm very happy with it. It has been my go to \"text starts here\" application ever since I bought it after hearing it mentioned on an episode of the Mac Power Users at some point - and it has become more than that over time. With the scripts and actions I can now write entire blog posts in Drafts, and could even upload them to the server and post them immediately if I wanted. This app has more than earnt it's position in my dock and will be there for the foreseeable future. \nOther Reviews\n\nTim Nahumck has written a much longer and more in depth review over on MacStories: Drafts 5: The MacStories Review\nColin Walker has a nice overview from the perspective of someone who has been using Drafts for many versions: Welcome Drafts 5\nChristopher Lawley has a video: Drafts 5: A Powerful Text Editor and Automation Tool for the iPad &amp; iPhone\nJosh Ginter on the Sweet Setup tells you about all the new features: Drafts 5 launches with tagging, workspaces, advanced scripting functionality, and much more\nMacSparky tells you about how he uses it: Big Update for Drafts\nAndre at Digitally Speaking Lab gives us a brief overview: Drafts 5 for iOS\nMac Rumors: Drafts 5 Overhauls Note-Taking App With New Themes, Editor Options and Action Features\n\nGet The App\nDrafts 5 is available in the App Store from today.",

Whether or not your task has a due date you can set a custom or fixed notification which will happen at the date and time you specify - very helpful.

            "content_text": "\nI'm fortunate enough to have been let into the very early OmniFocus 3 Beta. The app isn't finished yet,  but here are some of the features which you might enjoy. To make things clear, I have the dark theme on OF3, and the light theme in OF2 - and I've tried to do screenshots to let you compare the two easily. \nMulti Pane Views\nYou can now have a multipane view, this means you can have the traditional Home Screen on the left, tasks in the middle, and the inspector (detailed view of a task, project or tag) on the right - or you can have any combination of these three.\n\n\n\nForecast View\nThere have been some changes to the Forecast view as well - primarily the interleaving of tasks and calendar events. This is purely based on the due time of a task and the time of the calendar event.\n\n\n\n\nA new feature is the ability to have a tag displayed in the forecast view. This might be very handy if you have lots of #waiting on tasks which you need to be on top of, or if there's a particular area you need to focus on. Of course, if you want multiple tags that's what perspectives are for.\n\nThe Inspector\n\nThe inspector for tasks, tags, and projects has received some updates. You can set what you want to see and hide by default - so if you never use locations in tags (or contexts as they are in OF2) you can hide them.\nThe Project Inspector\n\n\n\nThe Tag Inspector\n\n\n\nThe Task Inspector\n\n\n\nAnd of course these changes are present on the iPad as well. \nSearch\nSearch can now happen from any view, just by pulling down on the tasks list. Previously it was in the bar at the top. \n\n\nLocation Based Notifications\nThe notifications have had some changes made to them as well. Here on the top you see OmniFocus 3, and below it you see OmniFocus 2. Omnifocus 2 shows you the name of the context, the first task, and the number of other tasks available. OmniFocus 3 shows you the name of the tag, and how many tasks are available to you. \n\nThe watch notifications are exactly the same. At first glance this seems like it is less information - but force touching or 3D touching the notification (depending on which device you're on) gives us a lot more choice.\n\n\nOmniFocus 3 here lets me View Location, or View Actions. OmniFocus 2 lets me dismiss the notification. \n\n\nNotifications\nNotifications have had an overhaul - gone are the days where you get pinged as something goes from \"hell being about to break loose\" to \"apocalypse\", you can now set up a series of notifications for a task. If your task has a due date you can set reminders to happen X amount of time before it becomes due by adding minutes, hours, or days. Whether or not your task has a due date you can set a custom or fixed notification which will happen at the date and time you specify - very helpful. These notifications are one off, but the customisability is definitely something I'll be using frequently. \n\n\n\nFlagging\nA task or project is flagged or isn't flagged. A task can inherit a tag from the project or task it belongs to - and none of this has changed in OmniFocus 3. What has changed is how you tag things. You can simply swipe from left to right on a task or project, and tap to flag it.\n\nYou can also see very easily when a task is flagged because its parent is flagged which is very nice.\n\nQuick Editing\nSo swiping from left to right lets you flag or unflag, swiping in the other direction allows you to delete the task, or if you tap more you can schedule it - for today or tomorrow. \n\n \nBatch Task Editing\nIt's now possible to edit multiple tasks at once as well - this is hard to explain in screenshots so I've created a very short video for you.\n\n    \n\nTo summarise, I absolutely love the beta of OmniFocus 3. There are things planned for this iOS app which haven't yet arrived, and many exciting new possibilities.

Due to the width of the street and the fact that it can be used for delivery vehicles Apple had prepared further waiting areas towards the other side of the street. The few of us tailing past the end of the ropes were asked to move to the middle and remain in order. Once that area filled up they moved on to the next and further on. Of course this meant there were lots of people milling around between the queues - but Apple had thought of that. When each queue was allowed to progress to the next one every person was given a card. You had to show this to enter the next queue, and then hand it over when exiting the queue or just before entering the store. This was a very simple but efficient system and prevented queue jumping. <\/p>\n<p>Thankfully the security managing the queues were multi lingual and friendly enough to allow you to make a quick bathroom or coffee run - assuming the people standing next to you in the queue were happy to hold your spot that was, they did stop allowing that at 9am though (30 minutes before the store opened). While we were in the queue four employees came through to photograph everyone and get permission to use your photo in their marketing material. If you didn't want to be featured they did request permission to take a photo anyway so they could work on an exclusion basis rather than an inclusion basis. At around 8:30am staff brought out coffee for people in the queue which was very much appreciated.<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"lightbox\"

            "content_text": " The first Apple Store in Austria opened today, and it happened to be the 501st Apple Store. I attended the opening and was lucky enough not to be too far back in the line - lots of people seem to have arrived before midnight, including one man from China who arrived at 2pm the day before! At it was cold I only got there at 7am.\nThis store matches Apple's new style with plants indoors, but they're using Genius tables and the grove is outside. All of the employees were there today and seemed to be really enjoying it - everyone I spoke to was enthusiastic and friendly, a few looked a little overwhelmed but that is to be expected!\nThe Day Before\n\n\n\n\n\nOpening Day\nWhen I got to the store the queue was just going past the end of the barrier. Due to the width of the street and the fact that it can be used for delivery vehicles Apple had prepared further waiting areas towards the other side of the street. The few of us tailing past the end of the ropes were asked to move to the middle and remain in order. Once that area filled up they moved on to the next and further on. Of course this meant there were lots of people milling around between the queues - but Apple had thought of that. When each queue was allowed to progress to the next one every person was given a card. You had to show this to enter the next queue, and then hand it over when exiting the queue or just before entering the store. This was a very simple but efficient system and prevented queue jumping. \nThankfully the security managing the queues were multi lingual and friendly enough to allow you to make a quick bathroom or coffee run - assuming the people standing next to you in the queue were happy to hold your spot that was, they did stop allowing that at 9am though (30 minutes before the store opened). While we were in the queue four employees came through to photograph everyone and get permission to use your photo in their marketing material. If you didn't want to be featured they did request permission to take a photo anyway so they could work on an exclusion basis rather than an inclusion basis. At around 8:30am staff brought out coffee for people in the queue which was very much appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPostcards and a pin\nInstead of giving out t-shirts we were given postcards and a commemorative pin. The postcards are on lovely thick, cream card stock, and the design is raised on the front with a slight gloss. I've scanned them in to show you - but the designs do belong to Apple. These images are animated and shown on the screen at the back of the store on the ground floor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I left the store at just after 11am they were still letting people in - with the cheering still at full volume and enthusiasm. I'm really looking forward to shopping in my local Apple Store.",

When it runs Workflow will say something like this:\n\nGood morning Rose, it is 07:38.\nIn Vienna the weather will be mixed precipitation throughout the week, with temperatures rising to 6\u00b0C on Friday..\nThe current temperature is 0 degrees celcius.\nThere is a 11% chance of rain.\nYour iPad has 80% battery.\nYour calendar events for today are Shrove Tuesday, Work.\nThe top news headlines for today are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is some of your favourite music:\n\nAfter it speaks this it then plays some of my favourite music (shuffling from a playlist I chose). \nSo, how does this all work? \nWhen you import the Workflow it asks you three questions, what you name is, your Dark Sky Weather API, and the RSS feed of your favourite news source.\n\nYou can get your API Key from Dark Sky, on the free plan you get up to 1000 calls per day - more than enough for our Workflow.\nNext the Workflow gets the data we need:\n\nthe date\nthe titles of the last 6 items from the RSS feed\nthe current location and the name of it\nthe weather for your current location\nthe kind of device you're using\nthe battery level of the device you're using\nyour calendar events for today\n\nThen this information is inserted into the text, let's look at that again.\n\nGood morning Name, it is Current Time.\nIn City the weather will be Weather Summary.\nThe current temperature is Temperature degrees celcius.\nThere is a Rain %% chance of rain.\nYour Device Model has Battery Level% battery.\nCalendar Events.\nThe top news headlines for today are Headlines.\nHere is some of your favourite music:\n\nEverything in bold is a variable, replaced with data we either fetched from the internet, or collected from the device. After this text all that Workflow has to do is use the speak text action, and the play music action. \nThere are two current versions of the Workflow, an imperial version for those who prefer Farenheit and a metric version for those who prefer Celsius. If you download either of these you can have your device talk to you in the morning, and tell you about your day. ",

While it's not perfect - it certainly won't charge my massive 12.9\" iPad Pro in a hurry, it's more than good enough for nearly everything else.
