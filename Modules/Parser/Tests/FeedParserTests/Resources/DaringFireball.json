Apple may not own Virgin\nMobile, but Virgin Mobile is now utterly dependent on Apple and\nwill benefit through promotion in Apple Stores.</p>\n\n<p>We shouldn’t read too much into this deal, but at the very least\nit’s unusual to see a company like Virgin Mobile going all-in on\nthe iPhone. And it might point toward Apple dipping its toe into\nthe MVNO business.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Virgin Mobile is owned by Sprint (and thus uses Sprint&#8217;s back-end), and in my experience Sprint is the worst of the U.S. carriers, so this is not a panacea.

Uber may be\ngreat at technology, but unlike the businesses of Google,\nFacebook, Apple or Amazon, technology hasn’t proven to be a\nsignificant barrier to new entrants in ride-sharing. Across the\nglobe, Uber has dozens of competitors, and in many markets they\nhave grabbed the lion’s share of the ride-sharing market.</p>\n\n<p>Even if Uber fixes all of its current problems, it’s increasingly\nunlikely that it can live up to the inflated expectations that\ncome with the nearly $70 billion valuation that have made it the\nworld’s most valuable startup.

[&#8230;]</p>\n\n<p>The briefing, which offers a revealing window into the company’s\nobsession with secrecy, was the first of many Apple is planning to\nhost for employees. In it, Rice and Freedman speak candidly about\nApple’s efforts to prevent leaks, discuss how previous leakers got\ncaught, and take questions from the approximately 100 attendees.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There&#8217;s some irony in a leaked recording of an internal briefing on stopping leaks.</p>\n\n<p>This is news to me:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>However, Rice says, Apple has cracked down on leaks from its\nfactories so successfully that more breaches are now happening on\nApple’s campuses in California than its factories abroad. “Last\nyear was the first year that Apple [campuses] leaked more than the\nsupply chain,” Rice tells the room. “More stuff came out of Apple\n[campuses] last year than all of our supply chain combined.” [&#8230;]</p>\n\n<p>In the years since Tim Cook pledged to double down on secrecy,\nRice’s team has gotten better at safeguarding enclosures. “In 2014\nwe had 387 enclosures stolen,” he says. “In 2015 we had 57\nenclosures stolen, 50 of which were stolen on the night of\nannounce, which was so painful.” In 2016, Rice says the company\nproduced 65 million housings, and only four were stolen. “So it&#8217;s\nabout a one in 16 million loss ratio, which is unheard of in the\nindustry.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://megaphone.link/OUT5683339462\">There&#8217;s a short (15 minute) podcast that accompanies the report</a>, with Turton and The Outline&#8217;s Adrianne Jeffries.

         "content_html" : "\n<p>Medium seems to continue to grow in popularity as a publishing platform, and as it does, I’m growing more and more frustrated by their on-screen “engagement” turds. Every Medium site displays an on-screen “sharing” bar that covers the actual content I want to read. This is particularly annoying on the phone, where screen real estate is most precious. Now on iOS they’ve added an “Open in App” button that literally makes the last 1-2 lines of content on screen unreadable. To me these things are as distracting as having someone wave their hand in front of my face while I try to read.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/gruber/status/874304779622785024\">Here’s an annotated screenshot (and threaded rant)</a> I posted to Twitter while trying to read Steven Sinofksy’s WWDC 2017 trip report on my iPad Pro review unit last week.</p>\n\n<p>Safari already has a built-in Sharing button. It has all the options for sharing I need. And as I scroll the page, it disappears so that I can see as much text on screen as possible. Safari is designed to be reader-friendly, as it should be. But it’s trivial to get that Sharing button back when I want it – just tap the bottom of the screen and there it is. Easy.</p>\n\n<p>This is now a very common design pattern for mobile web layouts. Medium is far from alone. It’s getting hard to find a news site that <em>doesn’t</em> put a persistent sharing <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Adaringfireball.net+Dickbar&amp;ia=web\">dickbar</a> down there.</p>\n\n<p>More examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/misc/2017/06/dickbar-techcrunch.png\">TechCrunch</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/misc/2017/06/dickbar-vox.png\">Vox</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/misc/2017/06/dickbar-theverge.png\">The Verge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/misc/2017/06/dickbar-mashable.png\">Mashable</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/misc/2017/06/dickbar-wired.png\">Wired</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>TechCrunch&#8217;s waste of space deserves special mention, for having a persistent navbar at the top <em>and</em> a persistent ad, in addition to their sharing dickbar.</p>\n\n<p>I’m sure “engagement” does register higher with these sharing dickbars, but I suspect a big part of that is because of accidental taps. And even so, what is more important, readability or “engagement”? Medium wants to be about readability but that’s hard to square with this dickbar, and especially hard to square with the “Open in App” button floating above it.</p>\n\n<p>iOS also has a standard way to prompt users to install the app version of a website &#8212; <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/PromotingAppswithAppBanners/PromotingAppswithAppBanners.html\">Smart App Banners</a>. And it’s user-dismissible. </p>\n\n<p>For any piece over a page long, I read Medium pieces with Safari’s Reader Mode. Medium is supposed to <em>be</em> a reader-optimized layout by default. It should be one of the sites where you’re never even tempted to switch to Reader Mode.</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;m frustrated by this design pattern everywhere I see it. But I&#8217;m especially disappointed by Medium&#8217;s adoption of it. I don&#8217;t expect better from most websites. I do expect better from Medium.</p>\n\n<p>A website should not fight the browser. Let the browser provide the chrome, and simply provide the content. Web developers know this is right &#8212; these dickbars are being rammed down their throats by SEO experts. The SEO folks are the same dopes who came up with the genius strategy of requiring 5-10 megabytes of privacy-intrusive CPU-intensive JavaScript on every page load that slows down websites. Now they come to their teams and say, &#8220;Our pages are too slow &#8212; we gotta move to AMP so our pages load fast.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t expect to break through to the SEO shitheads running the asylums at most of these publications, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/20/technology/evan-williams-medium-twitter-internet.html\">but Medium is supposed to be good</a>. When people click a URL and see that it&#8217;s a Medium site, their reaction should be &#8220;Oh, good, a Medium site &#8212; this will be nice to read.&#8221; Right now it&#8217;s gotten to the point where when people realize an article is on Medium, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenjaminBrooks/status/874307515596525568\">they think</a>, &#8220;Oh, crap, it&#8217;s on Medium.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n    "

The iPhone didn&#8217;t use windows, per se, but there was a certain familiarity with having the titles and controls like Back/Close/Done buttons at the top.

Hopefully there will be video.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing: Forstall was obviously a divisive figure inside Apple. He saw himself as an indispensable man after Steve Jobs died, and it turns out he wasn&#8217;t.</p>\n\n<p>But there can be no dispute that Forstall led one of the most successful software projects ever undertaken. It&#8217;s a cliche to say that they achieved the impossible, but what Forstall&#8217;s team achieved was considered by many &#8212; including many of the members of the team &#8212; <em>impossible</em>. But they did it, and in the ensuing years they kept making iOS better and better.

But I know many people who worked on his iOS team, and most of them loved working for him, or at the very least appreciated working for him. The thing I&#8217;ve heard over and over is that Forstall was incredibly demanding, yes, but if you were on his team and did good work he had your back.</p>\n\n<p>Forstall pretty much hasn&#8217;t said a damn thing about Apple since he left the company five years ago. So if he opens up at all to Markoff, this could be fascinating. His team&#8217;s story about actually <em>implementing</em> the original iPhone <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jsmaria/status/875283947399327745\">remains largely untold</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘John Markoff to Interview Scott Forstall Next Week’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/06/15/markoff-forstall\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

You see more of every animation.\nText is more legible when you scroll and doesn’t judder. It’s\nhard to explain and it has to be seen and experienced to be\nfully understood. Every scroll, page transition, and app launch\nanimation on the 10.5″ iPad Pro is <em>absurdly</em> smooth to the point\nof feeling unrealistic at first &#8212; hence the common reaction\nthat something doesn’t quite compute. But as you spend some time\nwith the new iPad and start using it on a daily basis, its\ndisplay becomes normal and you wish that other Apple displays\nwere the same.</p>\n\n<p>I’m not even a week into my tests with the 10.5″ iPad Pro, and\nI think scrolling on my first-gen 12.9″ iPad Pro looks choppy\nnow. I’d be surprised if 120Hz displays with ProMotion don’t\nexpand to the iPhone later this year and other Apple computers\nin the future. The combination of hardware and software really\nis <em>that</em> good.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Last year when True Tone was introduced with the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, Phil Schiller said something to the effect of &#8220;Once you get used to True Tone, you can&#8217;t go back.&#8221; I optimistically took that as a sign that the iPhone 7 would have True Tone. It did not, and the reason is probably that True Tone requires additional hardware sensors on the front face to pick up the ambient light temperature, and the iPhone has less room for additional sensors. But with ProMotion, I&#8217;m <em>really</em> hopeful that it&#8217;ll make its way into this year&#8217;s new iPhones. ProMotion doesn&#8217;t require additional sensors &#8212; only a super-fast GPU (which the iPhone will have) and intricate software support in iOS (which work Apple has already done for the iPad Pro).</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s really hard to quote just one bit from Viticci&#8217;s review. If you only thoroughly read one review of the new iPad Pro, it should be his. Nobody outside Apple cares as much about iPad as he does.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Matthew Panzarino, TechCrunch, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/12/apple-pays-off-its-future-of-computing-promise-with-ipad-pro/\">&#8220;Apple Pays Off Its Future-of-Computing Promise With iPad Pro&#8221;</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>After playing with the new iPad Pro 10.5&#8221; for a few days, I am\nconvinced that it’s fairly impossible to do a detailed review of\nit in its current state.</p>\n\n<p>Not because there is some sort of flaw, but because it was clearly\ndesigned top to bottom as an empty vessel in which to pour iOS 11.</p>\n\n<p>Every feature, every hardware advancement, every piece of\nunderstated technical acrobatics is in the service of making\nApple’s next-generation software shine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Dieter Bohn, The Verge, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/12/15779156/apple-new-ipad-pro-review-2017-10-5-tablet-ios\">&#8220;iPad Pro 10.5 Review: Overkill&#8221;</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I was all set to complain that increasing the size from 9.7 to\n10.5 was not a big enough jump to justify requiring people to buy\nnew keyboards and accessories. Then I started typing on the\non-screen keyboard and on the new hardware Smart Keyboard. Even\nthough I’m dubious about Apple’s claim that the software keyboard\nis “full size”, I find the slight size increase makes touch typing\nmuch easier. It’s still a little cramped, but it’s much easier to\nbounce between this and a real keyboard now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It really does make a difference in typing, and no practical difference at all in terms of holdability.</p>\n\n<p>Bohn again:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To me, if you’re going to spend $650 on a computer, it should\nalmost surely be your main computer. And if you’re going to make\nthe iPad Pro your main computer, you should probably get more than\n64GB of storage and you should also probably get a keyboard to go\nwith it (to say nothing of the Apple Pencil). It hits the $1,000\nmark very quickly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t agree with the notion that a $650 computer should be your &#8220;main computer&#8221; at all. Apple stuff isn&#8217;t for the budget-conscious &#8212; news at 11.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Brian X. Chen, The New York Times, &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/12/technology/ipad-pro-review-apple.html\">New iPad Pro Inches Toward Replacing PC, but Falls Short</a>&#8221;:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Five years later, Mr. Jobs’s successor, Timothy D. Cook, took the\niPad a step further. Unveiling the iPad Pro, a souped-up tablet\nthat worked with Apple’s keyboard and stylus, he remarked that\npeople would try the product and “conclude they no longer need to\nuse anything else, other than their phones.”</p>\n\n<p>That prediction has not appeared to come true. Many professionals\nsay they use an iPad in addition to a personal computer, and sales\nof iPads have shrunk quarter after quarter for more than a year,\nan indication that hordes of people were not trading in their PCs\nfor tablets just yet.</p>\n\n<p>That situation is unlikely to change with Apple’s newest iPad Pro,\nwhich will be released this week. [&#8230;] But after about a week of\ntesting the 10.5-inch iPad Pro, I concluded that Apple’s\nprofessional tablet still suffers from some of the same problems\nwhen compared with a laptop.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a slanted truncation of Cook&#8217;s quote. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/01/21/apples-tim-cook-declares-the-end-of-the-pc-and-hints-at-new-medi/\">Cook&#8217;s full quote</a>: &#8220;Yes, the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many, many people. They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones.&#8221; Chen&#8217;s truncation makes it sound like Cook claimed the iPad Pro was a Mac or Windows replacement for everyone. He didn&#8217;t. And the fact that the new iPad Pro debuted alongside new MacBooks, MacBook Pros, and even more-megahertz-in-the-box MacBook Airs shows that Apple doesn&#8217;t think so either. <strong>Update:</strong> And I completely forgot to mention the solid updates to the iMacs and the announcement of the iMac Pro.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;<em>I prefer a laptop to an iPad Pro</em>&#8221; is very different from &#8220;<em>A laptop is better than an iPad Pro</em>&#8221;. Me, personally, <em>I</em> much prefer working on a MacBook Pro to an iPad Pro. But I can see why others feel the opposite. That&#8217;s the whole point of Apple&#8217;s strategy of keeping them separate, rather than unifying them Microsoft Surface-style.</p>\n\n<p>iPad&#8217;s slowly diminishing sales are a real thing. But I don&#8217;t think that can be used as a gauge for whether more and more people are using an iPad as their main computer. And iPad sales are still more than double those of the Mac. There&#8217;s no reason to doubt that &#8220;many, many people&#8221; <em>are</em> concluding they no longer need a Mac or PC.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Andrew Cunningham, Ars Technica, &#8220;<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/apple/2017/06/review-10-5-inch-ipad-pro-is-pro-hardware-patiently-waiting-for-pro-software/\">The 10.5-Inch iPad Pro Is Much More “Pro” Than What It Replaces</a>&#8221;:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Of all the computers Apple sells, none of them has screens that do\nquite as much <em>stuff</em> as the iPad Pros are doing.</p>\n\n<p>That list starts with DCI-P3 color gamut support (new in the\n12.9-inch Pro, returning to the smaller one) and an\nanti-reflective coating, features also present in recent iMacs and\nMacBook Pros. But the True Tone feature, which detects the color\ntemperature of the ambient light, adjusts the display’s color\ntemperature to match. Most significantly, the iPad’s refresh rate\nhas been bumped up to 120Hz, twice the normal 60Hz. The screens in\nthe iPad Pros are the best screens Apple ships, which is\nappropriate for a thing that’s just a giant screen by design.</p>\n\n<p>The 10.5-inch Pro has a 2224×1668 screen, up just a little bit\nfrom the 2048×1536 in 9.7-inch iPads. The density is identical, so\nphotos and text are exactly the same size they were before; you\ncan just fit a bit more of them on-screen at once.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s important to note. There was <a href=\"https://blog.studioneat.com/why-would-apple-release-a-10-5-ipad-ca4441f7f628\">some clever speculation by Dan Provost</a> a few months ago that the 10.5-inch iPad would have the same pixel dimensions as the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, with a higher pixels-per-inch density. That&#8217;s what Apple did with the iPad Mini. The problem with that speculation is that while the math worked out, the size of things on screen would not. Everything would be shrunk by 20 percent. Not everyone&#8217;s eyes can handle that. That&#8217;s fine for the Mini &#8212; which is often used by sharp-eyed children &#8212; but not fine for the standard size iPad.</p>\n\n<p>I had been thinking that maybe what Apple would do is what Provost suggested, but offer a choice between standard and zoomed mode like the Plus-sized iPhones do. Nope. I think what they&#8217;ve done is better though, because I think a scaled &#8220;zoomed&#8221; interface would look blurry at just 324 ppi. The iPhone Plus displays have a resolution of 401 ppi.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Harry McCracken, Fast Company, &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/40429655/10-5-inch-ipad-pro-review-a-better-window-into-the-world-of-apps\">A Better Window Into The World Of Apps</a>&#8221;:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You can suss out a lot about Apple’s priorities from the aspects\nof a product it leaves alone and the ones it never stops\nobsessing over.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the iPad. <em>Every</em> generation of Apple’s tablet since the\nfirst one in 2010 has had the same stated battery life–“up to 10\nhours”–which suggests that the company thinks that shooting for\nanything in excess of that would be wasted effort.</p>\n\n<p>That 2010 iPad weighed a pound and a half, and felt a bit hefty in\nthe hand. With 2013’s iPad Air, Apple whittled that down to about\na pound. And there the mid-sized iPads have stayed,\nweight-reduction mission accomplished.</p>\n\n<p>However, when it comes to the iPad’s display, Apple has never been\nsatisfied to rest on its technological laurels.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n    "

Merchant seemingly has many first-hand sources on the record, including Tony Fadell and perhaps Scott Forstall. (I say &#8220;perhaps&#8221; because it&#8217;s not clear from the excerpt whether Forstall spoke to Merchant, or if Merchant got the Forstall quotes from somewhere else. It seems like there should be a <em>lot</em> more from Forstall in this story if he actually talked to Merchant.)</p>\n\n<p>But Fadell spoke to Merchant extensively, including this shot at Phil Schiller:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The iPod phone was losing support. The executives debated which\nproject to pursue, but Phil Schiller, Apple’s head of marketing,\nhad an answer: Neither. He wanted a keyboard with hard buttons.\nThe BlackBerry was arguably the first hit smartphone. It had an\nemail client and a tiny hard keyboard. After everyone else,\nincluding Fadell, started to agree that multitouch was the way\nforward, Schiller became the lone holdout.</p>\n\n<p>He “just sat there with his sword out every time, going, ‘No,\nwe’ve got to have a hard keyboard. No. Hard keyboard.’ And he\nwouldn’t listen to reason as all of us were like, ‘No, this works\nnow, Phil.’ And he’d say, ‘You gotta have a hard keyboard!’”\nFadell says.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s true or not that Schiller was singlehandedly pushing for a Blackberry-style keyboard. But even if true, it only looks foolish in hindsight, especially if this argument took place <em>before</em> the iPhone&#8217;s software team had come up with a proof-of-concept software keyboard. Today it&#8217;s clear that the iPhone needed a good keyboard, and that a touchscreen keyboard can be a good keyboard. Neither of those things was obvious in 2005. And in the context of this story, it&#8217;s clear that at the time of this purported argument, Steve Jobs and Apple weren&#8217;t yet sure if the iPhone should be a pocket-sized personal computer or a consumer electronics product that would have no more need for a keyboard (hardware or software) than an iPod did. My guess is that Schiller was insisting that the iPhone needed to be a personal computer, not a mere gadget, and it wasn&#8217;t unreasonable to believe a software keyboard wouldn&#8217;t be good enough. For chrissakes there were critics who insisted that the iPhone&#8217;s software keyboard wasn&#8217;t good enough for years <em>after</em> the iPhone actually shipped.</p>\n\n<p>I do know that Schiller&#8217;s hard-charging, brusque style and his obvious political acumen have made him a lot of enemies over the years. It sounds like Fadell is one of them.</p>\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ll just say this: this story about Phil Schiller pushing for a hardware keyboard comes from one source (so far &#8212; if anyone out there can back that up, my window is always open for little birdies), and that one source is the guy who admittedly spent over a <em>year</em> working on iPhone prototypes with a click wheel interface.</p>\n\n<p>Then there&#8217;s this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Schiller didn’t have the same technological acumen as many of the\nother execs. “Phil is not a technology guy,” Brett Bilbrey, the\nformer head of Apple’s Advanced Technology Group, says. “There\nwere days when you had to explain things to him like a\ngrade-school kid.” Jobs liked him, Bilbrey thinks, because he\n“looked at technology like middle America does, like Grandma and\nGrandpa did.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hats off to Bilbrey for putting his name on this quote, but having spoken to Schiller both on- and off-the-record many times, the idea that he &#8220;looks at technology &#8230; like Grandma and Grandpa did&#8221; and needs things explained to him &#8220;like a grade-school kid&#8221; is bullshit. Especially off-the-record, Schiller can drill down on technical details to a surprising degree. I don&#8217;t know what Schiller did to piss off Bilbrey, but Bilbrey either has a huge chip on his shoulder or was severely misquoted by Merchant.<sup id=\"fnr1-2017-06-13-a\"><a href=\"#fn1-2017-06-13\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I sure wish this book excerpt had come out <em>before</em> <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2017/06/08/ep-193\">my live episode of The Talk Show last week</a> &#8212; now I <em>do</em> have one more question I wish I&#8217;d gotten to ask Schiller.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-2017-06-13\">\n<p>Here&#8217;s a story from Yoni Heisler for Network World <a href=\"http://www.networkworld.com/article/2226373/data-center/brett-bilbrey--head-of-apple-s-technology-advancement-group--retires.html\">on Brett Bilbrey&#8217;s retirement from Apple in 2014</a>. Bilbrey headed Apple&#8217;s Technology Advancement Group. Merchant describes Bilbrey as having led &#8220;Apple’s Advanced Technology Group&#8221;. It&#8217;s a small detail, and the names are clearly similar, but the Advanced Technology Group was Larry Tesler&#8217;s R&D division at Apple, from 1986-1997.

         "content_html" : "\n<p>I’ve spent the last week using a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, and this is, in many ways, the easiest product review I’ve ever written. There are several significant improvements to the hardware, and <em>no</em> tradeoffs or downsides. There is no “<em>but</em>”.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Display:</strong> The new iPad Pros have the best displays of any computer I’ve ever seen. True Tone plus ProMotion is simply terrific. (The first generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro didn’t have True Tone; with these new models, the only noticeable difference between the 12.9- and 10.5-inch models is the size.) You really do have to see the 120 Hz refresh rate in person &#8212; and play with it while scrolling content on screen &#8212; to get it. You can actually read text as it’s moving during a scroll. It’s not as significant as the jump from non-retina to retina, but it’s in that ballpark.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Pencil:</strong> The latency of the Apple Pencil on a first-generation iPad Pro is the best I had ever seen for any stylus on any device at any price. The latency of the Apple Pencil on the new iPad Pro is so much better &#8212;  so much closer to ink-on-paper imperceptibility &#8212; that you have to try it to believe it. It’s the one thing that really makes the first-gen iPad Pro feel &#8220;slow&#8221;.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Size:</strong> The increase in size is perfect. The footprint for a “regular” iPad has, until now, remained unchanged since the original iPad in 2010. That 9.7-inch display size was nearly perfect. This 10.5-inch display size is better though. Apple said during the keynote that typing on the on-screen keyboard is surprisingly better given just a bit more room, and I agree. And typing on the Smart Keyboard cover is <em>way</em> better than on last year’s 9.7-inch iPad Pro. In hand it doesn’t feel bigger at all. It feels like there were no trade-offs whatsoever in increasing the display size and overall device footprint. Part of that is because the weight has remained completely unchanged. I have had zero problems &#8212; not one &#8212; with the decreased bezel area. Apple’s inadvertent touch detection game is on point.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Battery:</strong> Battery life is great, as expected.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Performance:</strong> Apple’s in-house chip team continues to amaze. No one buys an iPad because of CPU benchmarks, but the new iPad Pro’s CPU performance is mind-boggling. Forget about comparisons to the one-port MacBook &#8212; the iPad Pro blows that machine out of the water performance-wise. The astounding thing is that the new iPad Pro holds its own against the MacBook <em>Pro</em> in single-core performance &#8212; around 3,900 on the Geekbench 4 benchmark for the iPad Pro vs. around 4,200–4,400 for the various configurations of 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pros.<sup id=\"fnr1-2017-06-12\"><a href=\"#fn1-2017-06-12\">1</a></sup> Multi-core performance has effectively <em>doubled</em> from the first generation of iPad Pro. That sort of year-over-year increase just doesn’t happen anymore, but here we are. The new iPad Pro gets a multi-core Geekbench 4 score of around 9200; the brand-new Core M3-based MacBook gets a multi-core score of around 6800. Again, this isn’t why people buy iPads &#8212; the iPad took off like a rocket in 2010 back when it was way slower (<em>way way way</em> slower) than even the slowest MacBook &#8212; but I think it is vastly underappreciated just how significantly Apple’s chip team is pulling ahead of the industry, especially Intel.<sup id=\"fnr2-2017-06-12\"><a href=\"#fn2-2017-06-12\">2</a></sup></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>All that said, the real story of these new iPad Pro models can’t be told today, because that story is iOS 11. I think iOS 11’s iPad-focused features are the entire reason why Apple waited until WWDC to unveil them. They could have held an event for them back in April, when they released the new starting-at-just-$329 9.7-inch iPad, but if they did, the only new software they could have demoed was Clips. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/03/21/new-apple-stuff\">I love Clips</a>, but it’s just a fun little tool and doesn’t show off anything particular to iPad compared to iPhone.</p>\n\n<p>Again, the new iPad Pro hardware is almost too good to be true, but the iPad story Apple unveiled last week is iOS 11.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not fair to review a product running a developer beta of the OS &#8212; let alone the <em>first</em> (and generally buggiest) beta. So let’s stop the “review” right here: the new iPad Pros running iOS 10.3.2 are the best iPads ever made. You shouldn’t hesitate to buy one today, and if you do get one now, you <em>should</em> wait until iOS 11 ships in the fall to upgrade, or at the very least wait for a non-developer public beta of iOS 11 this summer before upgrading.</p>\n\n<p>But if you are reckless enough to install the iOS 11 beta on the new iPad Pro? Holy smokes is this better. I used the iPad Pro for a full week with iOS 10.3.2 because that’s the product that’s shipping, but after upgrading to iOS 11 beta 1 this morning and using it to write this entire review,<sup id=\"fnr3-2017-06-12\"><a href=\"#fn3-2017-06-12\">3</a></sup> I’m just blown away by how much more useful this machine is, and how much easier it is to work with 5 or 6 apps at a time.</p>\n\n<p>I would never recommend running a beta of any OS on any device that’s used for production purposes, so don’t take this as such, but for me personally, I can’t see going back to iOS 10.3.2 on any iPad that can handle it. It feels like a hand has been untied from behind my back, and this amazing hardware has finally been allowed to run free.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-2017-06-12\">\n<p>You can browse Geekbench&#8217;s database of results for <a href=\"https://browser.primatelabs.com/mac-benchmarks\">Mac</a> and <a href=\"https://browser.primatelabs.com/ios-benchmarks\">iOS</a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2017-06-12\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn2-2017-06-12\">\n<p>Apple&#8217;s A10X chip is so high-performing that I think it&#8217;s put Apple in a slightly uncomfortable position marketing-wise. They can&#8217;t brag about it fully without making Intel (and by implication, their own MacBooks) look bad, and Intel remains an important partner for Apple. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a coincidence that the most impressive iPad demo during the keynote (and the one that contained the most bragging about its performance compared to PCs) was done by a third-party developer &#8212; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu59W1Pmq0U\">Ash Hewson of Serif, demonstrating Affinity Photo</a> &#8212; not Greg Joswiak or anyone else from Apple.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr2-2017-06-12\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn3-2017-06-12\">\n<p>Full disclosure: I went back to my Mac to write these 3 footnotes. That&#8217;s due more to the byzantine way I mark up footnotes than any limitation inherent to iOS vs. MacOS. But it feels worth noting.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr3-2017-06-12\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n\n\n    "

I’m pretty sure it’s\nimpossible for any app to scan my iPhone for viruses or malware,\nsince third party apps are sandboxed to their own data, but let’s\nkeep reading…</p>\n\n<p>“You will pay $99.99 for a 7-day subscription”</p>\n\n<p>Uhh… come again?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There should be <em>no</em> &#8220;virus and malware&#8221; scanners in the App Store. None. iOS does not need anti-virus software. The App Store sandboxing rules mean that anti-virus software couldn&#8217;t really do anything useful anyway. And by allowing them to be listed on the store, it creates the false impression that Apple thinks you <em>might</em> need anti-virus software.</p>\n\n<p>But do-nothing anti-virus utilities that are scamming people into $100/week subscriptions? That&#8217;s downright criminal.</p>\n\n<p>Lin shows that &#8220;Mobile protection :Clean &amp; Security VPN&#8221; is not alone. The productivity top-grossing list is riddled with similar scam apps. </p>\n\n<p>Given how many legitimate developers are still having problems getting their apps approved due to seemingly capricious App Store reviewer decisions, it&#8217;s doubly outrageous that these apps have made their way onto the store in the first place. These are the <em>exact</em> sort of apps that the App Store review process should be primarily looking to block.</p>\n\n<p>And there is no excuse for Apple not having flagged them after the fact, once they started generating significant revenue. It&#8217;s downright mind boggling that this horrendous &#8220;Mobile protection :Clean &amp; Security VPN&#8221; app made it all the way into the top 10 without getting flagged.</p>\n\n<p>Based on Lin&#8217;s research, the pattern is simple:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Create a scammy utility app and get it into the store. Make it a free download with an expensive in-app subscription.</li>\n<li>Bid on common keywords like &#8220;virus&#8221;, &#8220;VPN&#8221;, and &#8220;wi-fi&#8221;.</li>\n<li>Get tens of thousands of downloads thanks to the top-of-results placement from the ad.</li>\n<li>Spring the in-app subscription prompt on your users and make money with a response rate of even just a fraction of 1 percent.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Apple needs to remove these apps from the App Store, and prevent such apps from getting into the store in the first place. They should reconsider the effects of allowing developers to buy their way to the top spot in search results. And they should police the top-grossing lists for apps that are pulling scams &#8212; the most important scams to catch are the successful ones.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, every single dollar these apps have generated should be refunded to the victims of these scams.</p>\n\n\n\n    "
