IMHO the only reason a reader developer <i>wouldn't</i> do it is because they want to lock users in.

For reading, I encouraged Richard to look at \"Electric River\", it's the closest to what Radio UserLand did with aggregation in 2002. It runs on your Mac desktop, as the original did. When he wants to go all-in with rivers, nothing can take the place of \"River5\", which is getting both modular and deep. I'm doing more work on that. Rivers have not finished evolving as far as I'm concerned. ",
