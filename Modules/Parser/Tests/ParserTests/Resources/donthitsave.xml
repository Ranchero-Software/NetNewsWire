<p>For real.</p>

<p>This happened as I took the dogs on their morning poop stroll (I can no longer speak or spell the word “walk” in my home). I wandered up and down the sidewalk, on some grass, and headed back home.</p>

<p>Near the end of the walk, I stopped to fiddle with my phone. I was listening to a podcast, and needed to skip the commercials. I stood in place for 30, maybe 40 seconds. When I was done, I took two steps... <a href="https://donthitsave.com/comic/2019/05/24/skipping-around">[read more]</a></p>]]></description>	</item>	<item>		<title>Budgets</title>		<pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2019 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>		<link>https://donthitsave.com/comic/2019/05/17/budgets</link>		<description><![CDATA[<img style="max-width:800px;" alt="Budgets" src="https://donthitsave.com/comicimages/dhs_2019-05-17_budgets.png"><p>It&#39;s time I woke up before dawn again.</p>


<p>Voluntarily.</p>


<p>It not easy to beat the sun at its own game.  Most of my social and computer life has been dominated by a late nights.  I work during the day because I have to, then stay up as late as I want because I&#39;m a grown up.  Every once in a while, however, I will mix things up:</p>

<p>When I was little, mine was excellent. I could spot animals while walking at night, read in low light conditions, and effectively navigate the house based on the light of digital clocks. It only got better with time.</p>


<p>This wasn't a super power. I was adjusting to my surroundings.</p>


<p>I spent my younger years in upstate NY. Winter and cloudy weather seemed to last 9 months, which meant that I got used to gloomy conditions.

<p>So why are you spending your time here?</p>

<p>Oh I know, you need some sort of control sample. What’s the point of having compelling and enjoyable entertainment if you don’t have something dull to compare it to? I see. It all makes sense now.</p>

<p>Wow. I can’t believe you think this comic dull. Nice, reader, reeeeeaaaal nice.

<p>This is the first one ever delayed at length by my news. Here's why:</p>

<p>I wrote the comic on Thursday night. When I went to write the news in the morning, I decided to focus on the adorable habits of my two dogs. One of the monsters was acting weird. Comically weird.</p>

<p>I decided to write the news about that. I found it quite funny. I wrote a page and a half about how my dog was suddenly scared of everything.

I love the food here in Hawaii, but when breakfast, lunch, and dinner consists of fish and noodles, things tend to get weird when I deviate.</p>

<p>I left about as big a mess as you can imagine while stirring the “food”.  I’m not a great cook, I’m an adequate one.  My system involves hopping from one nearly burning pile of food to another, narrowly staying ahead of a charred, blackened meal.</p>
