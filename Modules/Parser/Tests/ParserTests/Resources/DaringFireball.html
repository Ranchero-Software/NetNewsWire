  <p>&#8220;The iPhone is a county owned telephone that may have connected to the San Bernardino County computer network.

  <p>When I first learned Apple was opposing the order I was frustrated that it would be yet another roadblock. But as I read more about their case, I have come to understand their fight is for something much bigger than one phone. They are worried that this software the government wants them to use will be used against millions of other innocent people. I share their fear.</p>

<p>I support Apple and the decision they have made. I don’t believe Tim Cook or any Apple employee believes in supporting terrorism any more than I do. I think the vicious attacks I’ve read in the media against one of America’s greatest companies are terrible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I&#8217;ve been working to help secure computer systems for the entirety of my professional career. It is incredibly difficult to build computer systems that are not vulnerable to attack. As we&#8217;ve seen, a number of companies and governments have had great difficulty protecting the front door of their computer systems. I&#8217;ve dedicated my career to making sure our systems are designed, built, and operated to the most secure standards. And even with that tremendous investment, bugs still happen. Due to the many layers of security controls built into our systems software bugs are usually not damaging or catastrophic in nature. But peeling away those layers of control to create a backdoor means that even the most basic security bug could potentially have a catastrophic effect. This reality is missing from our current debate about the FBI&#8217;s order to Apple in the San Bernardino tragedy.</p>

  <p>Speaking to journalists at the Geneva auto show, Marchionne said
there was sufficient capacity available among car makers to deal

partner with a car manufacturer rather than become an actor itself
in such a &#8220;complex business&#8221;.</p>

<p>I can see it now: the Fiat Rokr.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;If they have any urges to make a car, I&#8217;d advise them to lie down

they&#8217;re not lethal.&#8221;</p>

<p>David Sparks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then I stated using Apple Notes and the strangest thing happened.
I liked it. Not only is Apple Notes a contender, Apple has
continued to refine the product. Just last week we got a new beta
of an upcoming Mac OS X release that includes additional Apple
Notes features. One of those new features is the ability to import
Evernote and plain text files. It seemed to me like a perfect
excuse to slurp in the rest of my nvALT database so I could really
push the application&#8217;s limits. Now I&#8217;ve got 787 notes in my Apple
Notes database. It&#8217;s growing daily.</p>

<p>So first this was all a big experiment to see what was wrong with
Apple Notes and then I just started using the application. I
didn&#8217;t admit to myself, or anyone else, that I become an Apple
Notes user but apparently I have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that its syncing is based on CloudKit instead of IMAP, and with the features that have been added in iOS 9 and Mac OS X 10.11, Apple Notes is a solid notes app. I echo Sparks on this complaint:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That doesn&#8217;t mean Apple Notes is without fault. I wrote before,
and it still remains true, that the text size on the Mac version
is just too small. They keep adding new features with the betas
and it keeps amazing me that they don&#8217;t address this problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s almost mind boggling that you can&#8217;t change the default font size on the Mac. It&#8217;s not just a matter of preference, it&#8217;s a genuine accessibility problem. You can hit ⌘+ to increase the font size of the current note, but there&#8217;s no way to change the default for new notes. So if Helvetica 12 is too small for you to read, you&#8217;re stuck hitting ⌘+ for every single note.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> And why is it Helvetica instead of San Francisco? Does the Apple Notes Mac team live in a cave?</p>

<p>Michael Heilemann, writing for his remarkable Kitbashed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the things I find so interesting about <em>Star Wars</em> is how the
creative process so clearly wasn’t locked from the beginning. It
was a long and winding road, and throughout writing the essays for
Kitbashed I’ve found that despite intense pressure there was
always an energetic adventurousness with ideas which inevitably
lead to some of the most iconic designs in film history.</p>

<p>The Falcon is a great example of that, specifically because the
final design is so distinct. It makes it a much more enticing to
try to decipher how it came about.</p>

<p>While I’ve been pursuing this subject for years, it wasn’t until I
starting putting together this essay that I finally began to find
some of the finer details of the Falcon’s creation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Millennium Falcon is my favorite thing in all of Star Wars &#8212; and it was <em>almost</em> something altogether different. The original design was a fine space ship, but it had none of the character the actual Falcon has.</p>

</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sarah Jeong, reporting for Motherboard:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A couple of representatives were openly hostile to Comey, but most
launched passive aggressive, loaded questions at the FBI director.
Even though the representatives (both Democrats and Republicans)
were mostly polite, the tone of the the questioning was a huge
departure from how the House Judiciary Committee typically
addresses Comey.</p>

<p>“I would be deeply disappointed if it turns out the government is
found to be exploiting a national tragedy to pursue a change in
the law,” Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) told Comey. […] The questions
got more hostile. Rep. Conyers asked Comey if the San Bernardino
case was an “end-run around this committee” &#8212; a loaded question
that Comey of course denied. […]</p>

<p>After that, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) opened his questioning by
quoting the late Justice Antonin Scalia: “There is nothing new in
the realization that the Constitution sometimes insulates the
criminality of a few in order to protect the privacy of all of
us.” Issa’s questioning was overtly hostile in tone, delving deep
into the technical details of the iPhone 5c. Comey was at loss,
admitting, “I have not answered the questions you have asked me
today and I am not entirely sure I understand the questions.”</p>

<p>Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) then said to Comey, “As I was hearing your
opening statement talking about a world where everything is
private, it may be the alternative is a world where nothing is
private. Because once you have holes in encryption, the question
is not if but when those holes will be exploited.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m actually not surprised at the hostility toward Comey. Democrats tend to support civil liberties against overreach from law enforcement, and Republicans &#8212; especially those in today&#8217;s House of Representatives &#8212; are extremely skeptical of an ever-more-powerful federal government. And both Republicans and Democrats yesterday seemed aware that the FBI&#8217;s use of the All Writs Act is, as Conyers put it, &#8220;an end-run around&#8221; Congress.</p>

<p>If there&#8217;s one thing that can unite both parties in today&#8217;s polarized Congress, it is the protection of congressional authority. The idea that the Department of Justice (which is part of the Executive Branch) and the Judicial Branch could dictate the terms of this debate is not going to fly.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> To be clear, there was also hostility toward Apple. That was expected by everyone. Some congresspeople are card-carrying members of the <a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2016/02/new-member-of-the-golden-key-wizard-society/">Golden Key Wizard Society</a>.</p>

we’ve come as much as an extra 0.4 degrees further in just the

virtually certain that February handily beat the record set just

<p>Glenn Greenwald and Jenna McLaughlin, reporting for The Intercept:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Judge Orenstein applied previous legal decisions interpreting the
AWA and concluded that the law does not “justif[y] imposing on
Apple the obligation to assist the government’s investigation
against its will.” In a formulation extremely favorable to Apple,
the judge wrote that the key question raised by the government’s
request is whether the AWA allows a court “to compel Apple &#8212; a
private party with no alleged involvement in Feng’s criminal
activity &#8212; to perform work for the government against its will.”</p>

<p>The court ruled that the law permits no such result &#8212; both
because relevant law contains limits on what companies like Apple
are required to do, and because Congress never enacted any such
obligations. Moreover, the judge said of the government’s
arguments for how the AWA should be applied: “The implications of
the government’s position are so far-reaching &#8212; both in terms of
what it would allow today and what it implies about congressional
intent in 1789 &#8212; as to produce impermissibly absurd results.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems like great news for Apple and supporters of civil liberties in this case.</p>

<p>I hope I don&#8217;t have to keep <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/02/29/useful-information">repeating</a> this, but this is the wrong argument to make. The implication is that the result should be different if the iPhone in question was &#8220;likely&#8221; to contain valuable information. That&#8217;s wrong. Civil liberties apply equally in all situations.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; I&#8217;m glad they&#8217;re saying this particular iPhone is unlikely to actually contain useful information. But someday there will be a locked iPhone that is either likely or certain to contain useful information.</p>

  <p>I just don’t understand the narrative around Twitter. “It is in
trouble. It isn’t growing. It’s time has come and gone. The kids
all use Snapchat and Instagram.”</p>

<p>That last part is true, to a degree. But it isn’t as simple
as that.</p>

<p>The presumptive Republican nominee for President of the United
States has largely conducted his campaign on Twitter and in
massive public appearances that feel like rock concerts. He has
avoided the traditional media channels and taken his message
direct to the people on Twitter. Not on Facebook. Not on
Instagram. Not on Snapchat. Not on Pinterest. Not on his website
or mobile app. On Twitter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He makes a good point, but I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a contradiction. On the one hand, Twitter is a powerful publishing platform that has become the de facto official medium for famous people to make public statements about what is going on right now.</p>

<p>The problem is, that&#8217;s not the description of a social network. It&#8217;s a description of a publishing platform. Twitter&#8217;s trouble is that it&#8217;s being viewed by investors as a social network.</p>

<p>Ellen Nakashima, writing for The Washington Post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Former Justice Department official Jennifer Daskal said both sides
are overstating their arguments. “The government is wrong to say
this is just about one case,” said Daskal, a law professor at
American University. “On the other hand, it is wrong to say that
if Apple loses this case, there’s absolutely no limits to what the
government can order a company to do” in cases involving encrypted
communications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is false equivalence. The government really <em>is</em> wrong about this case being about just this one particular phone. But nobody (and certainly not Apple) is using words like &#8220;absolutely no limits to what the government can order a company to do&#8221; to describe what will happen if the government wins and sets precedent. The results will be <em>significant</em>, and I think chilling &#8212; but not limitless. This is just a bullshit quote to make the story sound &#8220;balanced&#8221;.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One argument that companies and civil liberties groups are
expected to make is that if the government’s order is upheld,
then the FBI might be able to order a technology firm to create,
say, malicious software to send to a user’s device in the form of
a routine update. “That is the third rail for tech companies &#8212;
to be forced to deliver a software update that breaks the
security of the device,” said Alex Abdo, a staff attorney for the
American Civil Liberties Union, which is also filing a brief in
support of Apple.</p>

Connect and share out to Twitter and whatnot, but why? There’s
nothing unique or powerful about Apple’s system that makes it a
good hub. Because I have no idea how many followers we have, I
can’t even make a numerical argument for Connect-first posting.
And since we can’t even invite people from other places to follow
us on Connect, there’s no incentive to try.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As we have told them &#8212; and as we have told the American public &#8212;
building that software tool would not affect just one iPhone. It
would weaken the security for all of them. In fact, just last week
Director Comey agreed that the FBI would likely use this precedent
in other cases involving other phones. District Attorney Vance has
also said he would absolutely plan to use this on over 175 phones.
We can all agree this is not about access to just one iPhone.</p>

<p>The FBI is asking Apple to weaken the security of our products.
Hackers and cyber criminals could use this to wreak havoc on our
privacy and personal safety. It would set a dangerous precedent

<p>Jeff Gamet, writing for The Mac Observer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The iPhone recovered from Syed Farook after he shot and killed 14
coworkers and then died in a shootout with police most likely
doesn&#8217;t hold any valuable information. So says San Bernardino
police chief Jarrod Burguan. Chief Burguan was asked about the
phone during an NPR interview and he replied:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I&#8217;ll be honest with you, I think that there is a reasonably good
chance that there is nothing of any value on the phone. What we
are hoping might be on the phone would be potential contacts that
we would obviously want to talk to.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#8217;s a small point to be made here, insofar as it suggests the FBI is being disingenuous. They&#8217;re <em>saying</em> that it&#8217;s not about precedent, it&#8217;s just about this one phone, this one investigation. But the real reason they&#8217;re making a big deal out of it is that it&#8217;s politically useful. The phone itself likely isn&#8217;t important but the situation surrounding the phone &#8212; &#8220;terrorism&#8221; and the tragedy of 14 innocent people being killed &#8212; lends sympathy to their desire for access to encrypted devices all the time.</p>

<p>But for those of us on Apple&#8217;s side, this is not a point to hang our hats on. Even if law enforcement claimed to know with certainty that the phone contained useful information, Apple&#8217;s arguments would all still stand. Eventually there will be such a phone.</p>

<p>And, likewise, I&#8217;m glad law enforcement is doing their best to check the contents of the phone. We <em>want</em> law enforcement to pursue all leads &#8212; within the confines of the law &#8212; even those that are unlikely to produce useful information.</p>

  <p>Although 97% of Android phones have encryption as an option, less
than 35% of them actually got prompted to turn it on when they
first activated the phone. Even then, not everybody chooses that
extra layer of security.</p>

<p>A Google spokesman said that encryption is now required for all
&#8220;high-performing devices&#8221; &#8212; like the Galaxy S7 &#8212; running the
latest version of Android, Marshmallow. But only 1.2% of Android
phones even have that version, according to Google.</p>

<p>By comparison, most Apple products are uniformly secure: 94% of
iPhones run iOS 8 or 9, which encrypt all data. Apple (AAPL,
Tech30) makes its devices, designs the software, and retains full
control of the phone&#8217;s operating system.</p>

<p>&#8220;If a person walks into a Best Buy and walks out with an iPhone,
it&#8217;s encrypted by default. If they walk out with an Android phone,
it&#8217;s largely vulnerable to surveillance,&#8221; said Christopher
Soghoian, the principal technologist at the American Civil

  <p>In January, <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2016/01/22/apple-readies-iphone-5se-not-6c-for-marchapril-with-curved-edges-live-photos/">we reported that Apple is preparing a new 4-inch
iPhone</a> that is essentially 2013’s iPhone 5s with upgraded
internals. At the time, we heard that Apple would call the device
the “iPhone 5se” based on it being both an enhanced and “special
edition” version of the iPhone 5s. Now, we are hearing that Apple
appears to be going all in on the special edition factor: sources
say that Apple has decided to drop the “5” from the device’s name
and simply call it the “iPhone SE.” This will mark the first
iPhone upgrade without a number in its name and would logically
remove it from a yearly update cycle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few points:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Apple was never going to call this phone the &#8220;5 SE&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know where Gurman got that, but that was never going to happen. Why would Apple give a <em>new</em> phone a name that makes it sound old?</p></li>
<li><p>Isn&#8217;t it more accurate to think of this as an iPhone 6S in a 4-inch body than as an iPhone 5S with &#8220;upgraded internals&#8221;? Other than the display, aren&#8217;t the &#8220;internals&#8221; the defining characteristics of any iPhone?</p></li>
<li><p>Dropping the number entirely fits with my theory that this phone is intended to remain on the market for 18-24 months.</p></li>

The implication was that you shouldn&#8217;t use email on Gogo unless you&#8217;re using a VPN. </p>

<p>But Petrow&#8217;s email didn&#8217;t get intercepted because of some flaw with Gogo. It got intercepted because he wasn&#8217;t connecting to the POP or SMTP servers via SSL. In fact, his email provider, Earthlink, doesn&#8217;t even <em>support</em> SSL for email.</p>

<p>Robert Graham at Errata Security <a href="http://blog.erratasec.com/2016/02/early-internet-services-considered.html#.VtCA1eS6FaQ">explains</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Early Internet stuff wasn&#8217;t encrypted, because encryption was
hard, and it was hard for bad guys to tap into wires to eavesdrop.
Now, with open WiFi hotspots at Starbucks or on the airplane, it&#8217;s
easy for hackers to eavesdrop on your network traffic.
Simultaneously, encryption has become a lot easier. All new
companies, those still fighting to acquire new customers, have
thus upgraded their infrastructure to support encryption. Stagnant
old companies, who are just milking their customers for profits,
haven&#8217;t upgraded their infrastructure.</p>

<p>You see this in the picture below. Earthlink supports older
un-encrypted &#8220;POP3&#8221; (for fetching email from the server), but not
the new encrypted POP3 over SSL. Conversely, GMail doesn&#8217;t support
the older un-encrypted stuff (even if you wanted it to), but only
the newer encrypted version.</p>

<p>A clear, cogent read. I often shy away from reading legal motions because they&#8217;re so often written in dense legalese, but this one is clear.</p>

<p>This stuck out to me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Congress knows how to impose a duty on third parties to facilitate
the government’s decryption of devices. Similarly, it knows
exactly how to place limits on what the government can require of
telecommunications carriers and also on manufacturers of telephone
equipment and handsets. And in CALEA, Congress decided not to
require electronic communication service providers, like Apple, to
do what the government seeks here. Contrary to the government’s
contention that CALEA is inapplicable to this dispute, Congress
declared via CALEA that the government cannot dictate to providers
of electronic communications services or manufacturers of
telecommunications equipment any specific equipment design or
software configuration.</p>

<p>In the section of CALEA entitled “Design of features and systems
configurations,” 47 U.S.C. § 1002(b)(1), the statute says that it
“does not authorize any law enforcement agency or officer &#8212;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) to require any specific design of equipment, facilities,
    services, features, or system configurations to be adopted by
    any provider of a wire or electronic communication service,
    any manufacturer of telecommunications equipment, or any
    provider of telecommunications support services.</p>

<p>(2) to prohibit the adoption of any equipment, facility, service,
    or feature by any provider of a wire or electronic
    communication service, any manufacturer of telecommunications
    equipment, or any provider of telecommunications support
    services.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>What Apple is arguing is that the All Writs Act is intended only to fill the gaps covering scenarios not covered by other laws, but CALEA (the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act) is a law that was passed specifically to cover exactly this sort of scenario. This strikes me as a very compelling argument.</p>

<p>Tim Bradshaw, reporting for the Financial Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple is working on new ways to strengthen the encryption of
customers’ iCloud backups in a way that would make it impossible
for the company to comply with valid requests for data from law
enforcement, according to people familiar with its plans.</p>

<p>The move would bolster Apple customers’ security against hackers
but also frustrate investigators who are currently able to obtain
data from Apple’s servers through a court order. Apple has
complied with thousands of such orders in the past.</p>

<p>Developing such technology is in some ways more complex than
adding the kind of device-level security that Apple introduced to
the iPhone in 2014 with its iOS 8 update.</p>

<p>Building new protections that mean Apple no longer has access to
iCloud encryption keys may inconvenience some customers. Such a
change would most likely mean that customers who forget their
iCloud password may be left unable to access their photos,
contacts and other personal information that is backed up to
Apple’s systems.</p>

<p>Amy Davidson, writing for The New Yorker:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is essential to this story that the order to Apple is not a
subpoena: it is issued under the All Writs Act of 1789, which says
that federal courts can issue “all writs necessary or appropriate
in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the
usages and principles of law.” Read as a whole, this simply means
that judges can tell people to follow the law, but they have to do
so in a way that, in itself, respects the law. The Act was written
at a time when a lot of the mechanics of the law still had to be
worked out. But there are qualifications there: warnings about the
writs having to be “appropriate” and “agreeable,” not just to the
law but to the law’s “principles.” The government, in its use of
the writ now, seems to be treating those caveats as background
noise. If it can tell Apple, which has been accused of no
wrongdoing, to sit down and write a custom operating system for
it, what else could it do?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lost amid the technical debate over encryption is the legal debate over this incredibly broad application of the All Writs Act.</p>

<h6 class="dateline">Sunday, 21 February 2016</h6>

<p>The latest news in the Apple-FBI legal fight has resulted in much confusion. <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/johnpaczkowski/apple-terrorists-appleid-passcode-changed-in-government-cust">John Paczkowski, reporting for BuzzFeed</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The FBI has <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2716011/Apple-iPhone-Access-MOTION-to-COMPEL.pdf">claimed</a> that the password was changed by someone at
the San Bernardino Health Department. Friday night, however,
things took a further turn when the San Bernardino County’s
official Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/CountyWire/status/700887823482630144">stated</a>, “The County was working
cooperatively with the FBI when it reset the iCloud password at
the FBI’s request.”</p>

<p>County spokesman David Wert told BuzzFeed News on Saturday
afternoon the tweet was an authentic statement, but he had nothing
further to add.</p>

<p>The Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment on
Saturday; an Apple spokesperson said the company had no additional
comment beyond prior statements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2716011/Apple-iPhone-Access-MOTION-to-COMPEL.pdf">Here is what the FBI wrote in its legal motion</a>, in a footnote on the four ways Apple suggested they obtain the data they seek:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(3) to attempt an auto-backup of the SUBJECT DEVICE with the
    related iCloud account (which would not work in this case
    because neither the owner nor the government knew the password
    the iCloud account, and the owner, in an attempt to gain
    access to some information in the hours after the attack, was
    able to reset the password remotely, but that had the effect
    of eliminating the possibility of an auto-backup);</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To unpack this, the &#8220;owner&#8221; is <em>not</em> Syed Farook, the shooter. The iPhone at the center of this was supplied by Farook&#8217;s employer, the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health. They are the &#8220;owner&#8221;. The &#8220;government&#8221; is the federal government: the FBI and the Department of Justice.</p>

<p>The iPhone had been configured to back up to iCloud. However, at the time of the attack, it had not been backed up to iCloud for six weeks. Under warrant, Apple supplied the FBI with the data from that six-week-old backup. The FBI (for obvious reasons) would like the most recent six weeks of data from the phone, too.<sup id="fnr1-2016-02-21"><a href="#fn1-2016-02-21">1</a></sup></p>

<p>iCloud backups are triggered automatically when the phone is (a) on a known Wi-Fi network, and (b) plugged-in to power. Apple&#8217;s suggestion to the FBI was that if they took the iPhone to Farook&#8217;s office and plugged it in, it might trigger a backup. If that had worked, Apple could supply the FBI with the contents of that new backup, including the most recent six weeks of data.</p>

<p>It is not clear to me from any of the reports I have read <em>why</em> the iPhone had not been backed up in six weeks. It&#8217;s possible that Farook had disabled iCloud backups, in which case this whole thing is moot.<sup id="fnr2-2016-02-21"><a href="#fn2-2016-02-21">2</a></sup> But it&#8217;s also possible the only reason the phone hadn&#8217;t been backed up in six weeks is that it had not been plugged-in while on a known Wi-Fi network in six weeks. The phone would have to be unlocked to determine this, and the whole point of this fight is that the phone can&#8217;t be unlocked.</p>

<p>The FBI screwed this up by directing the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health to reset Farook&#8217;s Apple ID password. <em>They did not, and apparently could not, change anything on the phone itself.</em> But once they reset the Apple ID password, the phone could not back up to iCloud, because the phone needed to be updated with the newly-reset Apple ID password &#8212; and they could not do that because they can&#8217;t unlock the phone.</p>

<p>The key point is that you do not have to unlock an iPhone to have it back up to iCloud. But a locked iPhone <em>can&#8217;t</em> back up to iCloud if the associated Apple ID password has been changed.</p>

<p>Again, there are two password-type things at play here. The Apple ID (iCloud) password, and the four-digit device passcode locking the iPhone. The county, at the behest of the FBI, reset the Apple ID password. This did not allow them to unlock the iPhone, and, worse, it prevented the iPhone from initiating a new backup to iCloud.</p>

<p><em>How</em> did the county reset Farook&#8217;s Apple ID password? We don&#8217;t know for sure, but the most likely answer is that if his Apple ID was his work-issued email account, then the IT department at the county could go to <a href="https://iforgot.apple.com/">iforgot.apple.com</a>, enter Farook&#8217;s work email address, and then access his email account to click the confirmation URL to reset the password.</p>

<p>In short:</p>

<ul>
<li>The data the FBI claims to want is on Farook&#8217;s iPhone.</li>
<li>They already have access to his iCloud account.</li>
<li>They might have been able to transfer the data on his iPhone to his iCloud account via an automated backup, but they can&#8217;t because they reset his Apple ID (iCloud) password.</li>
</ul>

<p>The only possible explanations for this are incompetence or dishonesty on the part of the FBI. Incompetence, if they didn&#8217;t realize that resetting the Apple ID password could prevent the iPhone from backing up to iCloud. Dishonesty, if they directed the county to do this <em>knowing</em> the repercussions, with the goal of setting up this fight to force Apple to create a back door for them in iOS. I&#8217;m not sure which to believe at this point. I&#8217;d like to know exactly when this directive to reset the Apple ID password was given &#8212; &#8221; in the hours after the attack&#8221; leaves a lot of wiggle room.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘On the San Bernardino Suspect’s Apple ID Password Reset’" href="http://daringfireball.net/2016/02/san_bernardino_password_reset">&#9733;</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">

<li id="fn1-2016-02-21">
<p>Much (or all?) of the data stored on Apple&#8217;s iCloud backup servers is not encrypted. Or, if it is encrypted, it is encrypted in a way that Apple can decrypt. <a href="http://images.apple.com/privacy/docs/legal-process-guidelines-us.pdf">Apple has a PDF that describes the information</a> available to U.S. law enforcement from iCloud, but to me it&#8217;s not clear exactly what is available under warrant. I would bet a large sum of money that Apple is hard at work on an iCloud backup system that <em>does</em> store data encrypted in a way that Apple cannot read it without the user&#8217;s Apple ID password.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2016-02-21"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

<p>Another possibility: Farook&#8217;s iCloud storage was full. If this were the case, presumably Apple could have granted his account additional storage to allow a fresh backup to occur. But again, this became moot as soon as the county reset the Apple ID password at the behest of the FBI.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2016-02-21"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>

<h6 class="dateline">Wednesday,  3 February 2016</h6>

<p>Following up on <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/3/10900612/walt-mossberg-apple-iphone-ios-mac-osx-app-problems">Walt Mossberg&#8217;s column</a> regarding the quality of Apple&#8217;s first-party apps, <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2016/02/03/about-walt-mossberg-and-apples-app-problem/">Jim Dalrymple writes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I understand that Apple has a lot of balls in the air, but they
have clearly taken their eye off some of them. There is absolutely
no doubt that Apple Music is getting better with each update to
the app, but what we have now is more of a 1.0 version than what
we received last year.</p>

<p>Personally, I don’t care much about all the celebrities that Apple
can parade around &#8212; I care about a music service that works.
That’s it.</p>

<p>If Apple Music (or any of the other software that has
problems) was the iPhone, it would never have been released in
the state it was.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Software and hardware are profoundly different disciplines, so it&#8217;s hard to compare them directly. But it seems obvious to me that Apple, institutionally, has higher standards for hardware design and quality than it does for software.</p>

<p>Maybe this is the natural result of the fact hardware standards <em>must</em> be high, because they can&#8217;t issue &#8220;hardware updates&#8221; over the air like they can with software. But the perception is now widespread that the balance between Apple&#8217;s hardware and software quality has shifted in recent years. I see a lot of people nodding their heads in agreement with Mossberg and Dalrymple&#8217;s pieces today.</p>

<p>We went over this same ground a year ago in the wake of Marco Arment&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://marco.org/2015/01/04/apple-lost-functional-high-ground">Apple Has Lost the Functional High Ground</a>&#8221;, culminating in a really interesting (to me at least) <a href="http://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2015/06/09/ep-123">discussion with Phil Schiller at my &#8220;Live From WWDC&#8221; episode of The Talk Show</a>. That we&#8217;re still talking about it a year later &#8212; and that the consensus reaction is one of agreement &#8212; suggests that Apple probably does have a software problem, and they <em>definitely</em> have a perception problem.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll offer a small personal anecdote. Overall I&#8217;ve had great success with iCloud Photo Library. I&#8217;ve got over 18,000 photos and almost 400 videos. And I&#8217;ve got a slew of devices &#8212; iPhones, iPads, and Macs &#8212; all using the same iCloud account. And those photos are available from all those devices. Except, a few weeks ago, I noticed that on my primary Mac, in Photos, at the bottom of the main &#8220;Photos&#8221; view, where it tells you exactly how many photos and videos you have, it said &#8220;Unable to Upload 5 Items&#8221;. Restarting didn&#8217;t fix it. Waiting didn&#8217;t fix it. And clicking on it didn&#8217;t do anything &#8212; I wanted to know <em>which</em> five items couldn&#8217;t be uploaded, and why. It seems to me that anybody in this situation would want to know those two things. But damned if Photos would tell me.</p>

<p>Eventually, I found <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7174772?start=0&amp;tstart=0">this support thread</a> which suggested a solution: you can create a Smart Group in Photos using &#8220;Unable to upload to iCloud Photo Library&#8221; as the matching condition. Bingo: five items showed up. (Two of them were videos for which the original files couldn&#8217;t be found; three of them were duplicates of photos that were already in my library.)</p>

<p>My little iCloud Photo Library syncing hiccup was not a huge deal &#8212; I was even lucky insofar as the two videos that couldn&#8217;t be found were meaningless. And I managed to find a solution. But it feels emblematic of the sort of nagging software problems people are struggling with in Apple&#8217;s apps. Not even the bug itself that led to these five items being unable to upload, but rather the fact that Photos knew about the problem but wouldn&#8217;t tell me the details I needed to fix it without my resorting to the very much non-obvious trick of creating a Smart Group to identify them. For me at least, &#8220;silent failure&#8221; is a big part of the problem &#8212; almost everything related to the whole <a href="http://daringfireball.net/s/discoveryd">discoveryd/mDNSresponder fiasco</a> last year was about things that just silently stopped working.</p>

<p>Maybe we expect too much from Apple&#8217;s software. But Apple&#8217;s hardware doesn&#8217;t have little problems like this.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘Apple’s App Problem’" href="http://daringfireball.net/2016/02/apples_app_problem">&#9733;</a></p>

<h6 class="dateline">Wednesday, 20 January 2016</h6>

<p><a href="http://recode.net/2016/01/19/how-donald-trump-got-everything-wrong-about-apple-in-one-sentence/">Arik Hesseldahl, writing for Recode</a> on Donald Trump&#8217;s &#8220;we’re gonna get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries&#8221; campaign promise:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any honest presidential candidate regardless of party should say
clearly and indeed proudly that America doesn’t want these jobs to
come back. Final assembly jobs are low-skilled, low-paying
occupations; no American would wish to support a family on what
the jobs would pay. Workers at China’s Foxconn, which
manufacturers the iPhone, make about $402 per month after three
months of on-the-job probation. Even at the lowest minimum wage in
the U.S. &#8212; $5.15 an hour in Wyoming &#8212; American workers can’t
beat that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s not that simple. These jobs are certainly menial, but they&#8217;re not low-skill. <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-apple-tim-cook-charlie-rose/">As Tim Cook said on 60 Minutes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Charlie Rose: So if it&#8217;s not wages, what is it?</p>

<p>Tim Cook: It&#8217;s skill. [&#8230;]</p>

<p>Charlie Rose: They have more skills than American workers? They
have more skills than &#8212;</p>

<p>Tim Cook: Now &#8212; now, hold on.</p>

<p>Charlie Rose: &#8212; German workers?</p>

<p>Tim Cook: Yeah, let me &#8212; let me &#8212; let me clear, China put an
enormous focus on manufacturing. In what we would call, you and I
would call vocational kind of skills. The U.S., over time, began
to stop having as many vocational kind of skills. I mean, you can
take every tool and die maker in the United States and probably
put them in a room that we&#8217;re currently sitting in. In China, you
would have to have multiple football fields.</p>

<p>Charlie Rose: Because they&#8217;ve taught those skills in their
schools?</p>

<p>Tim Cook: It&#8217;s because it was a focus of them &#8212; it&#8217;s a focus of
their educational system. And so that is the reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wages are a huge factor, but for the sake of argument, let&#8217;s say Apple was willing to dip into its massive cash reserves and pay assembly line workers in the U.S. a good wage. Where would these U.S.-made iPhone be assembled? A year ago <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2015/01/27Apple-Reports-Record-First-Quarter-Results.html">Apple sold 75 million iPhones in the fourth quarter of calendar 2014</a>. There is no facility in the U.S. that can do that. There might not be anywhere in the world <em>other than China</em> that can operate at that sort of scale. That&#8217;s almost one million iPhones per day. 10 iPhones <em>per second</em>. Think about that.</p>

<p>You can say, well, Apple could dig even deeper into its coffers and build such facilities. And train tens of thousands of employees. But why would they? Part of the marvel of Apple&#8217;s operations is that they can assemble and sell an unfathomable number of devices but they&#8217;re not on the hook for the assembly plants and facilities. When iPhones go the way of the iPod in 10 or 15 or 20 years, Apple doesn&#8217;t have any factories to close or convert for other uses. Foxconn does.</p>

<p>The U.S. can&#8217;t compete with China on wages. It can&#8217;t compete on the size of the labor force. China has had a decades-long push in its education system to train these workers; the U.S. has not. And the U.S. doesn&#8217;t have the facilities or the proximity to the Asian component manufacturers.</p>

<p>The only way Apple could ever switch to U.S. assembly and manufacturing would be if they automated the entire process &#8212; to build machines that build the machines. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSj6kvv7_Sg">That, in fact, is what NeXT did while they were in the hardware business</a>. But NeXT only ever sold <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT">about 50,000 computers total</a>. Apple needed to assemble 35,000 iPhones per <em>hour</em> last year.</p>

<p>So long as assembling these devices remains labor intensive, it has to happen in China. And if someday it becomes automated &#8212; if the machines are built by machines &#8212; by definition it&#8217;s not going to create manufacturing jobs.<sup id="fnr1-2016-01-20"><a href="#fn1-2016-01-20">1</a></sup>&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘Why Apple Assembles in China’" href="http://daringfireball.net/2016/01/why_apple_assembles_in_china">&#9733;</a></p>

<p>I do wonder about the purported Apple car. Would that be assembled in China, too? The U.S. does have automobile manufacturing expertise.
