<p>Josh Centers, writing for TidBITS on Virgin Mobile&#8217;s intriguing decision to go iPhone-only:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pundits have long suspected that two roadblocks stood in the way
of Apple becoming a carrier: the infrastructure is incredibly
expensive, even if you lease it from the larger carriers, and
Apple could limit the iPhone business if it were to compete with
the major carriers.</p>

<p>But Apple has sidestepped those concerns by essentially taking
over a carrier (actually a carrier-owned MVNO &#8212; Mobile Virtual
Network Operator) without acquiring it. Apple may not own Virgin
Mobile, but Virgin Mobile is now utterly dependent on Apple and
will benefit through promotion in Apple Stores.</p>

<p>We shouldn’t read too much into this deal, but at the very least
it’s unusual to see a company like Virgin Mobile going all-in on
the iPhone. And it might point toward Apple dipping its toe into
the MVNO business.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Virgin Mobile is owned by Sprint (and thus uses Sprint&#8217;s back-end), and in my experience Sprint is the worst of the U.S. carriers, so this is not a panacea. But it is intriguing.</p>

<p>Rene Ritchie has a comprehensive look at the just-released <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/">public beta of iOS 11</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/26/ios-11-preview/">Romain Dillet has a good preview at TechCrunch too</a>. The gist of both previews: it&#8217;s the &#8220;<em>I hope Apple truly focuses on the iPad this year</em>&#8221; release of iOS that we&#8217;ve been waiting for.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using the developer betas on my 10.5-inch iPad Pro review unit and a spare iPhone. I&#8217;m willing to wait to install iOS 11 on my primary iPhone, but at this point, bugs be damned, I wouldn&#8217;t want to use an iPad running iOS 10.3. It&#8217;s stable enough, and the benefits of the great new features for iPad far outweigh the downsides of the beta (which, in addition to crashing bugs, include questionable battery life).</p>

<p>Mat Honan, writing for BuzzFeed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It has this wild new feature called Drop In. Drop In lets you give
people permission to automatically connect with your device.
Here’s how it works. Let’s say my father has activated Drop In for
me on his Echo Show. All I have to do is say, “Alexa, drop in on
Dad.” It then turns on the microphone and camera on my father’s
device and starts broadcasting that to me. For the several seconds
of the call, my father’s video screen would appear fogged over.
But then there he’ll be. And to be clear: This happens even if he
doesn’t answer. Unless he declines the call, audibly or by tapping
on the screen, it goes through. It just starts. Hello, you look
nice today.</p>

<p>Honestly, I haven’t figured out what to think about this yet. But,
it’s here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know what to think of this: <em>No fucking way do I want this</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I&#8217;ve already gotten a few reader responses arguing that this feature could be great for an Echo Show in the home of an elderly relative. You visit and set it up in their house, explain to them what it does, and then you can check in with them without their needing to do anything at all. I can see that. You can think of it as the digital equivalent of having a set of keys to someone&#8217;s house &#8212; something you&#8217;d only grant to a deeply trusted friend or loved one.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>From a Tumblr help document euphemistically titled &#8220;Heads-Up for AT&amp;T Customers&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Starting on June 30, 2017, att.net customers will no longer be
able to log in to their Yahoo and Tumblr accounts through email
addresses with the following domains: att.net, ameritech.net,
bellsouth.net, flash.net, nvbell.net, pacbell.net, prodigy.net,
sbcglobal.net, snet.net, swbell.net, and wans.net.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sheer egregiousness of this is outrageous on its face, but it&#8217;s even worse when you consider that Tumblr, when it was independent, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/blog/netneutrality/articles/20170621/09400737642/tumblr-goes-radio-silent-net-neutrality-after-verizon-acquisition.shtml">was a champion for net neutrality</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/25/take-the-oath/">TechCrunch says it&#8217;s just a deal expiring, not spite</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As part of the new corporate merger of Yahoo and Aol under the
Oath brand, it looks like Yahoo accounts will no longer be
accessible through AT&amp;T email addresses (or those of any A&amp;T
subsidiaries).</p>

<p>The move provoked some uproar among net neutrality advocates, but
it seems to be less about creating walled gardens and more about
cleaning up prior commitments and pre-existing partnerships.
While there is a level of inconvenience for AT&amp;T customers, this
is less about net neutrality and more about unwinding those
corporate deals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I still say fuck Verizon and their stance on net neutrality.</p>

<p>Scott Galloway:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Amazon / Whole Foods will be the fourth-largest grocer in the US,
and will likely post growth rates no $10B+ retailer, sans Amazon,
has registered. The Seattle firm will apply its operational chops
and lower (zero) profit hurdle to the Whole Foods business model
and bring prices (way) down. If you wish you could shop at Whole
Foods more often, but it’s too expensive, your prayers have been
answered. Whole Foods will become the grocery equivalent of a
Mercedes for the price of a Toyota. Grocery has stuck their chin
out (little innovation), and the entire sector is about to have
its jaw shattered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s a great piece. I disagree with him on this though:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Amazon will displace Apple as the top tech hardware innovator,
with Alexa cementing itself as the gadget that defines the decade
(post iPhone). Grocery / commerce via Alexa will create the
utility that Alexa needs to [maintain its lead] over Google and
Apple’s home / voice offerings as they try to play catch-up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alexa may well maintain its lead in the smart speaker market. It may even grow. Maybe HomePod will be a complete bust. But even if all of that happens, the smartphone will remain the dominant device in people&#8217;s lives. Something will eventually replace the phone, but smart speakers aren&#8217;t it.</p>

<p>Hardware just isn&#8217;t where Amazon is good.</p>

<p>Mark Bergen, reporting for Bloomberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Google is stopping one of the most controversial advertising
formats: ads inside Gmail that scan users’ email contents. The
decision didn’t come from Google’s ad team, but from its cloud
unit, which is angling to sign up more corporate customers.</p>

<p>Alphabet Inc.’s Google Cloud sells a package of office software,
called G Suite, that competes with market leader Microsoft Corp.
Paying Gmail users never received the email-scanning ads like the
free version of the program, but some business customers were
confused by the distinction and its privacy implications, said
Diane Greene, Google’s senior vice president of cloud. “What we’re
going to do is make it unambiguous,” she said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is terrific news. Not just because it&#8217;s a good policy change in and of itself, but I take it as a sign that Google&#8217;s leadership is starting to realize how much damage they&#8217;ve done to the company&#8217;s reputation by playing fast and loose with their users&#8217; privacy.</p>

<p>Kyle Orland, reporting for Ars Technica:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since the days of the NES, people have accused Nintendo of
intentionally underproducing hardware in order to drive an
artificial feeding frenzy of demand in the marketplace. With the
Nintendo Switch remaining nearly impossible to find at retailers
nationwide, those same accusations of &#8220;false scarcity&#8221; have been
bubbling up in certain corners.</p>

<p>Nintendo Senior Director of Corporate Communications Charlie
Scibetta wants to push back on those accusations. &#8220;It&#8217;s definitely
not intentional in terms of shorting the market,&#8221; he told Ars in a
recent interview. &#8220;We&#8217;re making it as fast as we can. We want to
get as many units out as we can to support all the software that&#8217;s
coming out right now&#8230; our job really is to get it out as quick
as we can, especially for this holiday because we want to have
units on shelves to support <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben Sandofsky:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Popular social networking apps are over 400 megs. With weekly
releases, over one year you’ll download twenty gigs of data.</p>

<p>Since we launched <a href="https://halide.cam/">Halide</a>, the most unexpected compliment we’ve
heard is about its size. At 11 megs, we’ll push less data in one
year than a social network pushes in a single update.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you aren’t using Swift,&#8221; asked a friend. After all, Swift
bundles its standard libraries into your app, bloating its size.
Halide is almost entirely Swift. How did we do it? Let’s start
with the technical bits.</p>

<p>His conclusion is spot-on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There really is one weird trick to lose size: focus on your customers.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s getting to the point where most apps can&#8217;t be updated over cellular because they&#8217;re all over 100 MB. This is madness.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Many readers have written to argue that the listed sizes in the App Store aren&#8217;t what you actually download when updating an app, thanks to app thinning and other features. OK, but even with app thinning and delta updates <a href="http://www.everyinteraction.com/blog/bad-app-citizens/#update1">these apps are still way too big</a> as downloads and take up way too much storage on devices.</p>

<p>Kara Swisher:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was Lao Tzu who said that “the journey of a thousand miles
begins with a single step.”</p>

<p>In the case of complete and utter change reeling through Uber
right now &#8212; culminating in the resignation of its once
untouchable CEO Travis Kalanick &#8212; it turns out that it began with
one of the most epic blog posts to be written about what happens
when a hot company becomes hostage to its increasingly
dysfunctional and toxic behaviors.</p>

<p>It was clear from the moment you read the 3,000-word post by
former engineer Susan Fowler about her time at the car-hailing
company that nothing was going to be the same. Titled simply,
“<a href="https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber">Reflecting on one very, very strange year at Uber</a>,” the
essay deftly and surgically laid out the map that the media and
others would use to prove to its out-to-lunch board and waffling
investors that Uber CEO Travis Kalanick had to go.</p>

<p>The truth and courage are a powerful combination.</p>

<p>Great investigative work by Kashmir Hill and Surya Mattu for Gizmodo:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During a recent investigation into how a drug-trial recruitment
company called Acurian Health tracks down people who look online
for information about their medical conditions, we discovered
NaviStone’s code on sites run by Acurian, Quicken Loans, a
continuing education center, a clothing store for plus-sized
women, and a host of other retailers. Using Javascript, those
sites were transmitting information from people as soon as they
typed or auto-filled it into an online form. That way, the company
would have it even if those people immediately changed their minds
and closed the page. [&#8230;]</p>

<p>We decided to test how the code works by pretending to shop on
sites that use it and then browsing away without finalizing the
purchase. Three sites &#8212; hardware site Rockler.com, gift site
CollectionsEtc.com, and clothing site BostonProper.com &#8212; sent us
emails about items we’d left in our shopping carts using the email
addresses we’d typed onto the site but had not formally submitted.
Although Gizmodo was able to see the email address information
being sent to Navistone, the company said that it was not
responsible for those emails.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They weren&#8217;t responsible for sending the emails, but they were responsible for the email addresses being sent to those websites in the first place. Sending form data surreptitiously is morally wrong, and everyone knows it.</p>

<p>This might sound hyperbolic, but I mean it: I think we&#8217;d be better off if JavaScript had never been added to web browsers.</p>

<p>Christopher Mims, in his column for The Wall Street Journal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But even when it steers through that thicket of crises, Uber will
have to come to grips with a fundamental vulnerability that is
increasingly apparent in the company’s business model. Uber may be
great at technology, but unlike the businesses of Google,
Facebook, Apple or Amazon, technology hasn’t proven to be a
significant barrier to new entrants in ride-sharing. Across the
globe, Uber has dozens of competitors, and in many markets they
have grabbed the lion’s share of the ride-sharing market.</p>

<p>Even if Uber fixes all of its current problems, it’s increasingly
unlikely that it can live up to the inflated expectations that
come with the nearly $70 billion valuation that have made it the
world’s most valuable startup. There are barbarians at Uber’s
gate, and it’s sorely in need of a moat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is why they&#8217;re pursuing self-driving technology so aggressively. There&#8217;s simply no way that Uber is worth $70 billion without some sort of exclusive technical advantage. That&#8217;s the interesting flip side to Kalanick&#8217;s ouster &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure who would want the job.</p>

<p>Mike Isaac, reporting for The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Travis Kalanick’s final hours as Uber’s chief executive played out
in a private room in a downtown Chicago hotel on Tuesday.</p>

<p>There, Mr. Kalanick, who was on a trip to interview executive
candidates for Uber, was paid a surprise visit. Two venture
capitalists &#8212; Matt Cohler and Peter Fenton of the Silicon Valley
firm Benchmark, which is one of Uber’s biggest shareholders &#8212;
presented Mr. Kalanick with a list of demands, including his
resignation before the end of the day. The letter was from five of
Uber’s major investors, including Benchmark and the mutual fund
giant Fidelity Investments. [&#8230;]</p>

<p>By the end of the day, after hours of haggling and arguing, that
course was clear: Mr. Kalanick agreed to step down as Uber’s chief
executive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Truly great reporting from Isaac, including the fact that even during his brief &#8220;leave of absence&#8221;, he wasn&#8217;t really absent at all:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In reality, Mr. Kalanick had little intention of staying away from
his company. Almost immediately after announcing the leave of
absence, he worked the phones to push out Mr. Bonderman for making
the sexist comment onstage at an Uber employee meeting. With the
two increasingly at odds, Mr. Kalanick sent out a flurry of texts,
phone calls and emails to his allies to pressure Mr. Bonderman to
step down from Uber’s board. Hours later, Mr. Bonderman did.</p>

<p>Fascinating stories.</p>

<p>Forstall was great. It&#8217;s hard to believe he&#8217;s been out of Apple and out of the limelight for 5 years &#8212; watching him on stage with Markoff it feels like he never left.</p>

<p>Kara Swisher on Travis Kalanick:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Uber confirmed the resignation, and the company’s board issued a
statement that said, in part: “Travis has always put Uber first.
This is a bold decision and a sign of his devotion and love for
Uber.” (For those who don&#8217;t speak fluent tech director, there are
four things in those two sentences that are not true.)</p>

<p>Mike Isaac, reporting for The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the letter, titled “Moving Uber Forward” and obtained by The
New York Times, the investors wrote to Mr. Kalanick that he must
immediately leave and that the company needed a change in
leadership. Mr. Kalanick, 40, consulted with at least one Uber
board member, and after long discussions with some of the
investors, he agreed to step down. He will remain on Uber’s board
of directors.</p>

<p>“I love Uber more than anything in the world and at this difficult
moment in my personal life I have accepted the investors request
to step aside so that Uber can go back to building rather than be
distracted with another fight,” Mr. Kalanick said in a statement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the outside, it seems like this was inevitable. It was only a question of when.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>William Turton has quite a scoop for The Outline:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A recording of an internal briefing at Apple earlier this month
obtained by The Outline sheds new light on how far the most
valuable company in the world will go to prevent leaks about new
products. [&#8230;]</p>

<p>The briefing, which offers a revealing window into the company’s
obsession with secrecy, was the first of many Apple is planning to
host for employees. In it, Rice and Freedman speak candidly about
Apple’s efforts to prevent leaks, discuss how previous leakers got
caught, and take questions from the approximately 100 attendees.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#8217;s some irony in a leaked recording of an internal briefing on stopping leaks.</p>

<p>This is news to me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, Rice says, Apple has cracked down on leaks from its
factories so successfully that more breaches are now happening on
Apple’s campuses in California than its factories abroad. “Last
year was the first year that Apple [campuses] leaked more than the
supply chain,” Rice tells the room. “More stuff came out of Apple
[campuses] last year than all of our supply chain combined.” [&#8230;]</p>

<p>In the years since Tim Cook pledged to double down on secrecy,
Rice’s team has gotten better at safeguarding enclosures. “In 2014
we had 387 enclosures stolen,” he says. “In 2015 we had 57
enclosures stolen, 50 of which were stolen on the night of
announce, which was so painful.” In 2016, Rice says the company
produced 65 million housings, and only four were stolen. “So it&#8217;s
about a one in 16 million loss ratio, which is unheard of in the
industry.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://megaphone.link/OUT5683339462">There&#8217;s a short (15 minute) podcast that accompanies the report</a>, with Turton and The Outline&#8217;s Adrianne Jeffries. It&#8217;s worth a listen. (It doesn&#8217;t seem possible to link directly to a single episode of their podcast, <a href="https://overcast.fm/+I0hy5PQco">so here&#8217;s a direct link for Overcast users</a>.)</p>

	<summary type="text">When people click a URL and see that it’s a Medium site, their reaction should be “Oh, good, a Medium site — this will be nice to read.” Right now it’s gotten to the point where when people realize an article is on Medium, they think, “Oh, crap, it’s on Medium.”</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Medium seems to continue to grow in popularity as a publishing platform, and as it does, I’m growing more and more frustrated by their on-screen “engagement” turds. Every Medium site displays an on-screen “sharing” bar that covers the actual content I want to read. This is particularly annoying on the phone, where screen real estate is most precious. Now on iOS they’ve added an “Open in App” button that literally makes the last 1-2 lines of content on screen unreadable. To me these things are as distracting as having someone wave their hand in front of my face while I try to read.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/874304779622785024">Here’s an annotated screenshot (and threaded rant)</a> I posted to Twitter while trying to read Steven Sinofksy’s WWDC 2017 trip report on my iPad Pro review unit last week.</p>

<p>Safari already has a built-in Sharing button. It has all the options for sharing I need. And as I scroll the page, it disappears so that I can see as much text on screen as possible. Safari is designed to be reader-friendly, as it should be. But it’s trivial to get that Sharing button back when I want it – just tap the bottom of the screen and there it is. Easy.</p>

<p>This is now a very common design pattern for mobile web layouts. Medium is far from alone. It’s getting hard to find a news site that <em>doesn’t</em> put a persistent sharing <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Adaringfireball.net+Dickbar&amp;ia=web">dickbar</a> down there.</p>

<p>More examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/misc/2017/06/dickbar-techcrunch.png">TechCrunch</a></li>
<li><a href="/misc/2017/06/dickbar-vox.png">Vox</a></li>
<li><a href="/misc/2017/06/dickbar-theverge.png">The Verge</a></li>
<li><a href="/misc/2017/06/dickbar-mashable.png">Mashable</a></li>
<li><a href="/misc/2017/06/dickbar-wired.png">Wired</a></li>
</ul>

<p>TechCrunch&#8217;s waste of space deserves special mention, for having a persistent navbar at the top <em>and</em> a persistent ad, in addition to their sharing dickbar.</p>

<p>I’m sure “engagement” does register higher with these sharing dickbars, but I suspect a big part of that is because of accidental taps. And even so, what is more important, readability or “engagement”? Medium wants to be about readability but that’s hard to square with this dickbar, and especially hard to square with the “Open in App” button floating above it.</p>

<p>iOS also has a standard way to prompt users to install the app version of a website &#8212; <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/PromotingAppswithAppBanners/PromotingAppswithAppBanners.html">Smart App Banners</a>. And it’s user-dismissible. </p>

<p>For any piece over a page long, I read Medium pieces with Safari’s Reader Mode. Medium is supposed to <em>be</em> a reader-optimized layout by default. It should be one of the sites where you’re never even tempted to switch to Reader Mode.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m frustrated by this design pattern everywhere I see it. But I&#8217;m especially disappointed by Medium&#8217;s adoption of it. I don&#8217;t expect better from most websites. I do expect better from Medium.</p>

<p>A website should not fight the browser. Let the browser provide the chrome, and simply provide the content. Web developers know this is right &#8212; these dickbars are being rammed down their throats by SEO experts. The SEO folks are the same dopes who came up with the genius strategy of requiring 5-10 megabytes of privacy-intrusive CPU-intensive JavaScript on every page load that slows down websites. Now they come to their teams and say, &#8220;Our pages are too slow &#8212; we gotta move to AMP so our pages load fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t expect to break through to the SEO shitheads running the asylums at most of these publications, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/20/technology/evan-williams-medium-twitter-internet.html">but Medium is supposed to be good</a>. When people click a URL and see that it&#8217;s a Medium site, their reaction should be &#8220;Oh, good, a Medium site &#8212; this will be nice to read.&#8221; Right now it&#8217;s gotten to the point where when people realize an article is on Medium, <a href="https://twitter.com/BenjaminBrooks/status/874307515596525568">they think</a>, &#8220;Oh, crap, it&#8217;s on Medium.&#8221;</p>

<p>iFixit gave the Surface Laptop a 0 out of 10 on their &#8220;Repairability Score&#8221;. The lowest anything from Apple has ever gotten is a 1, I believe.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Verdict: The Surface Laptop is not a laptop. It’s a glue-filled
monstrosity. There is nothing about it that is upgradable or
long-lasting, and it literally can’t be opened without destroying
it. (Show us the procedure, Microsoft, we’d love to be wrong.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>iFixit&#8217;s point of view on this is logical, and they&#8217;re certainly not alone in wishing for the good old days of user-accessible and user-upgradeable components. But it&#8217;s silly to argue that the Surface Laptop is &#8220;not a laptop&#8221; only because it&#8217;s a sealed box. It&#8217;s like saying the iPhone is not a phone because it doesn&#8217;t have a replaceable battery.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/AirPods+Teardown/75578">Apple&#8217;s AirPods got a 0/10 from iFixit</a>. That just goes to show how little correlation there is between iFixit&#8217;s concept of repairability and whether a product is good or not. I consider AirPods to be Apple&#8217;s best new product in years. </p>

<p>Standard Ebooks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Standard Ebooks is a volunteer driven, not-for-profit project
that produces lovingly formatted, open source, and free public
domain ebooks.</p>

<p>Ebook projects like <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> transcribe ebooks and
make them available for the widest number of reading devices.
Standard Ebooks takes ebooks from sources like Project
Gutenberg, formats and typesets them using a carefully designed
and professional-grade style guide, lightly modernizes them,
fully proofreads and corrects them, and then builds them to
take advantage of state-of-the-art ereader and browser
technology. [&#8230;]</p>

<p>Other free ebooks don’t put much effort into professional-quality
typography: they use &#34;straight&#34; quotes instead of “curly” quotes,
they ignore details like em- and en-dashes, and they look more
like early-90’s web pages instead of actual books.</p>

<p>The Standard Ebooks project applies a rigorous and modern
<a href="https://standardebooks.org/contribute/typography">typography manual</a> when developing each and every ebook to ensure
they meet a professional-grade and consistent typographical
standard. Our ebooks look <em>good</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a fantastic project. Project Gutenberg is an amazing library, but their books are a mess typographically. (<a href="https://twitter.com/waferbaby/status/876604431373975552">Via Daniel Bogan</a>.)</p>

<p>Randy Nelson, writing for the Sensor Tower blog:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to Sensor Tower’s analysis of <a href="https://sensortower.com/solutions/app-intelligence">App Intelligence</a>,
the total space required by the top 10 most installed U.S. iPhone
apps has grown from 164 MB in May 2013 to about 1.8 GB last month,
an 11&#215; or approximately 1,000 percent increase in just four years.
In the following report, we delve deeper into which apps have
grown the most.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple really needs to do something about this. It&#8217;s not just that these apps are too big, but some of them issue software updates every week (or even more frequently). It&#8217;s a huge waste of bandwidth, time, and on-device storage space.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At long last, the perfect score for arcade classic Ms. Pac-Man has
been achieved, though not by a human. Maluuba &#8212; a deep learning
team acquired by Microsoft in January &#8212; has created an AI system
that’s learned how to reach the game’s maximum point value of
999,900 on Atari 2600, using a unique combination of reinforcement
learning with a divide-and-conquer method.</p>

<p>Brad Ellis:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As devices change, our visual language changes with them. It’s
time to move away from the navbar in favor of navigation within
thumb-reach. For the purposes of this article, we’ll call that
Reach Navigation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This design trend is clearly already underway, and Ellis does a terrific job explaining why it&#8217;s a good idea.</p>

<p>I can think of a few factors that led to the original iPhone having a top-of-the-screen UI for navigation. First, at just 3.5 inches diagonally, the whole screen was reachable. But another factor might be as simple as the fact that &#8220;navigation&#8221; was always at the top on desktops &#8212; window titles and controls have always been at the top on Mac and Windows. The iPhone didn&#8217;t use windows, per se, but there was a certain familiarity with having the titles and controls like Back/Close/Done buttons at the top. Something like the iOS 10 bottom-heavy design of Apple Maps is wholly different from a desktop UI design &#8212; as it should be.</p>

<p>Great piece by Ben Thompson on Amazon&#8217;s intended acquisition of Whole Foods:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As Mackey surely understood, this meant that AmazonFresh was at a
cost disadvantage to physical grocers as well: in order to be
competitive AmazonFresh needed to stock a lot of perishable items;
however, as long as AmazonFresh was not operating at meaningful
scale a huge number of those perishable items would spoil. And,
given the inherent local nature of groceries, scale needed to be
achieved not on a national basis but a city one.</p>

<p>Groceries are a fundamentally different problem that need a
fundamentally different solution; what is so brilliant about this
deal, though, is that it solves the problem in a fundamentally
Amazonian way.</p>

<p>Mitchel Broussard:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At WWDC this year, Apple senior vice president of software
engineering Craig Federighi performed a demo of the company&#8217;s new
augmented reality platform, ARKit, while mentioning popular
furniture company IKEA as an upcoming partner in the technology.
Similarly, Apple CEO Tim Cook referenced an Ikea AR partnership in
a recent interview with Bloomberg Businessweek.</p>

<p>Now, Ikea executive Michael Valdsgaard has spoken about the
company&#8217;s partnership with Apple and ARKit, describing an all-new
augmented reality app that will help customers make &#8220;reliable
buying decisions&#8221; for Ikea&#8217;s big ticket items.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very cool idea &#8212; probably the sort of thing that&#8217;s going to be common soon. I&#8217;m curious how much of a leg up ARKit will give iOS on this front.</p>

<p>Blockbuster event next week at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How did iPhone come to be? On June 20, four members of the
original development team will discuss the secret Apple project,
which in the past decade has remade the computer industry, changed
the business landscape, and become a tool in the hands of more
than a billion people around the world.</p>

<p>Part 1: Original iPhone Engineers Nitin Ganatra, Scott Herz, and
Hugo Fiennes in Conversation with John Markoff</p>

<p>Part 2: Original iPhone Software Team Leader Scott Forstall in
Conversation with John Markoff</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It kills me that I can&#8217;t make this. Hopefully there will be video.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the thing: Forstall was obviously a divisive figure inside Apple. He saw himself as an indispensable man after Steve Jobs died, and it turns out he wasn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>But there can be no dispute that Forstall led one of the most successful software projects ever undertaken. It&#8217;s a cliche to say that they achieved the impossible, but what Forstall&#8217;s team achieved was considered by many &#8212; including many of the members of the team &#8212; <em>impossible</em>. But they did it, and in the ensuing years they kept making iOS better and better. It&#8217;s not just that they managed to ship the original iPhone OS in June 2007, but the entire run up through Forstall&#8217;s ouster from the company was simply amazing.</p>

<p>Across the company, it&#8217;s clear that Forstall&#8217;s style was not popular. But I know many people who worked on his iOS team, and most of them loved working for him, or at the very least appreciated working for him. The thing I&#8217;ve heard over and over is that Forstall was incredibly demanding, yes, but if you were on his team and did good work he had your back.</p>

<p>Forstall pretty much hasn&#8217;t said a damn thing about Apple since he left the company five years ago. So if he opens up at all to Markoff, this could be fascinating. His team&#8217;s story about actually <em>implementing</em> the original iPhone <a href="https://twitter.com/jsmaria/status/875283947399327745">remains largely untold</a>.</p>

<p>Nilay Patel, announcing a special episode of The Vergecast with <em>The One Device</em> author Brian Merchant:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And, of course, we talk about the quotes from Tony Fadell and
Brett Bilbrey in the excerpt we just published, in which Fadell
tells a story about Phil Schiller arguing the iPhone should have a
hardware keyboard. Schiller has said the story isn’t true, and
Fadell has tried to walk it back as well.</p>

<p>“So I wasn&#8217;t in the room at Apple 10, 15 years ago when this would
have happened,” says Merchant, who has the exchange on tape. “But
this is a quote verbatim as Tony Fadell who was in the room told
it to me. He told me this quote in such detail and he gave such a
vivid account, and I had no reason to believe it was untrue.”</p>

<p>Merchant says the controversy has “blown him away.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I figured Merchant had Fadell&#8217;s interview recorded. The quotes were too extensive not to have been recorded. It&#8217;s pretty clear what happened: Fadell told Merchant exactly what he&#8217;s quoted as saying, but now that he&#8217;s seen how it&#8217;s playing out, he wants to walk it back. It&#8217;s a little late for that.</p>

	<summary type="text">Highlights from the best of yesterday’s iPad Pro reviews.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Federico Viticci, MacStories, &#8220;<a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/the-10-5-ipad-pro-future-proof/">The 10.5-inch iPad Pro: Future-Proof</a>&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A good way to think about the iPad’s new display with ProMotion
is not the difference between low-res and Retina screens, but
the jump from 30fps to 60fps. You see more of every animation.
Text is more legible when you scroll and doesn’t judder. It’s
hard to explain and it has to be seen and experienced to be
fully understood. Every scroll, page transition, and app launch
animation on the 10.5″ iPad Pro is <em>absurdly</em> smooth to the point
of feeling unrealistic at first &#8212; hence the common reaction
that something doesn’t quite compute. But as you spend some time
with the new iPad and start using it on a daily basis, its
display becomes normal and you wish that other Apple displays
were the same.</p>

<p>I’m not even a week into my tests with the 10.5″ iPad Pro, and
I think scrolling on my first-gen 12.9″ iPad Pro looks choppy
now. I’d be surprised if 120Hz displays with ProMotion don’t
expand to the iPhone later this year and other Apple computers
in the future. The combination of hardware and software really
is <em>that</em> good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Last year when True Tone was introduced with the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, Phil Schiller said something to the effect of &#8220;Once you get used to True Tone, you can&#8217;t go back.&#8221; I optimistically took that as a sign that the iPhone 7 would have True Tone. It did not, and the reason is probably that True Tone requires additional hardware sensors on the front face to pick up the ambient light temperature, and the iPhone has less room for additional sensors. But with ProMotion, I&#8217;m <em>really</em> hopeful that it&#8217;ll make its way into this year&#8217;s new iPhones. ProMotion doesn&#8217;t require additional sensors &#8212; only a super-fast GPU (which the iPhone will have) and intricate software support in iOS (which work Apple has already done for the iPad Pro).</p>

<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s really hard to quote just one bit from Viticci&#8217;s review. If you only thoroughly read one review of the new iPad Pro, it should be his. Nobody outside Apple cares as much about iPad as he does.</p>

<hr />

<p>Matthew Panzarino, TechCrunch, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/12/apple-pays-off-its-future-of-computing-promise-with-ipad-pro/">&#8220;Apple Pays Off Its Future-of-Computing Promise With iPad Pro&#8221;</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After playing with the new iPad Pro 10.5&#8221; for a few days, I am
convinced that it’s fairly impossible to do a detailed review of
it in its current state.</p>

<p>Not because there is some sort of flaw, but because it was clearly
designed top to bottom as an empty vessel in which to pour iOS 11.</p>

<p>Every feature, every hardware advancement, every piece of
understated technical acrobatics is in the service of making
Apple’s next-generation software shine.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Dieter Bohn, The Verge, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/12/15779156/apple-new-ipad-pro-review-2017-10-5-tablet-ios">&#8220;iPad Pro 10.5 Review: Overkill&#8221;</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was all set to complain that increasing the size from 9.7 to
10.5 was not a big enough jump to justify requiring people to buy
new keyboards and accessories. Then I started typing on the
on-screen keyboard and on the new hardware Smart Keyboard. Even
though I’m dubious about Apple’s claim that the software keyboard
is “full size”, I find the slight size increase makes touch typing
much easier. It’s still a little cramped, but it’s much easier to
bounce between this and a real keyboard now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It really does make a difference in typing, and no practical difference at all in terms of holdability.</p>

<p>Bohn again:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To me, if you’re going to spend $650 on a computer, it should
almost surely be your main computer. And if you’re going to make
the iPad Pro your main computer, you should probably get more than
64GB of storage and you should also probably get a keyboard to go
with it (to say nothing of the Apple Pencil). It hits the $1,000
mark very quickly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#8217;t agree with the notion that a $650 computer should be your &#8220;main computer&#8221; at all. Apple stuff isn&#8217;t for the budget-conscious &#8212; news at 11.</p>

<hr />

<p>Brian X. Chen, The New York Times, &#8220;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/12/technology/ipad-pro-review-apple.html">New iPad Pro Inches Toward Replacing PC, but Falls Short</a>&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Five years later, Mr. Jobs’s successor, Timothy D. Cook, took the
iPad a step further. Unveiling the iPad Pro, a souped-up tablet
that worked with Apple’s keyboard and stylus, he remarked that
people would try the product and “conclude they no longer need to
use anything else, other than their phones.”</p>

<p>That prediction has not appeared to come true. Many professionals
say they use an iPad in addition to a personal computer, and sales
of iPads have shrunk quarter after quarter for more than a year,
an indication that hordes of people were not trading in their PCs
for tablets just yet.</p>

<p>That situation is unlikely to change with Apple’s newest iPad Pro,
which will be released this week. [&#8230;] But after about a week of
testing the 10.5-inch iPad Pro, I concluded that Apple’s
professional tablet still suffers from some of the same problems
when compared with a laptop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s a slanted truncation of Cook&#8217;s quote. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/01/21/apples-tim-cook-declares-the-end-of-the-pc-and-hints-at-new-medi/">Cook&#8217;s full quote</a>: &#8220;Yes, the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many, many people. They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones.&#8221; Chen&#8217;s truncation makes it sound like Cook claimed the iPad Pro was a Mac or Windows replacement for everyone. He didn&#8217;t. And the fact that the new iPad Pro debuted alongside new MacBooks, MacBook Pros, and even more-megahertz-in-the-box MacBook Airs shows that Apple doesn&#8217;t think so either. <strong>Update:</strong> And I completely forgot to mention the solid updates to the iMacs and the announcement of the iMac Pro.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>I prefer a laptop to an iPad Pro</em>&#8221; is very different from &#8220;<em>A laptop is better than an iPad Pro</em>&#8221;. Me, personally, <em>I</em> much prefer working on a MacBook Pro to an iPad Pro. But I can see why others feel the opposite. That&#8217;s the whole point of Apple&#8217;s strategy of keeping them separate, rather than unifying them Microsoft Surface-style.</p>

<p>iPad&#8217;s slowly diminishing sales are a real thing. But I don&#8217;t think that can be used as a gauge for whether more and more people are using an iPad as their main computer. And iPad sales are still more than double those of the Mac. There&#8217;s no reason to doubt that &#8220;many, many people&#8221; <em>are</em> concluding they no longer need a Mac or PC.</p>

<hr />

<p>Andrew Cunningham, Ars Technica, &#8220;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2017/06/review-10-5-inch-ipad-pro-is-pro-hardware-patiently-waiting-for-pro-software/">The 10.5-Inch iPad Pro Is Much More “Pro” Than What It Replaces</a>&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of all the computers Apple sells, none of them has screens that do
quite as much <em>stuff</em> as the iPad Pros are doing.</p>

<p>That list starts with DCI-P3 color gamut support (new in the
12.9-inch Pro, returning to the smaller one) and an
anti-reflective coating, features also present in recent iMacs and
MacBook Pros. But the True Tone feature, which detects the color
temperature of the ambient light, adjusts the display’s color
temperature to match. Most significantly, the iPad’s refresh rate
has been bumped up to 120Hz, twice the normal 60Hz. The screens in
the iPad Pros are the best screens Apple ships, which is
appropriate for a thing that’s just a giant screen by design.</p>

<p>The 10.5-inch Pro has a 2224×1668 screen, up just a little bit
from the 2048×1536 in 9.7-inch iPads. The density is identical, so
photos and text are exactly the same size they were before; you
can just fit a bit more of them on-screen at once.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s important to note. There was <a href="https://blog.studioneat.com/why-would-apple-release-a-10-5-ipad-ca4441f7f628">some clever speculation by Dan Provost</a> a few months ago that the 10.5-inch iPad would have the same pixel dimensions as the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, with a higher pixels-per-inch density. That&#8217;s what Apple did with the iPad Mini. The problem with that speculation is that while the math worked out, the size of things on screen would not. Everything would be shrunk by 20 percent. Not everyone&#8217;s eyes can handle that. That&#8217;s fine for the Mini &#8212; which is often used by sharp-eyed children &#8212; but not fine for the standard size iPad.</p>

<p>I had been thinking that maybe what Apple would do is what Provost suggested, but offer a choice between standard and zoomed mode like the Plus-sized iPhones do. Nope. I think what they&#8217;ve done is better though, because I think a scaled &#8220;zoomed&#8221; interface would look blurry at just 324 ppi. The iPhone Plus displays have a resolution of 401 ppi.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can suss out a lot about Apple’s priorities from the aspects
of a product it leaves alone and the ones it never stops
obsessing over.</p>

<p>Consider the iPad. <em>Every</em> generation of Apple’s tablet since the
first one in 2010 has had the same stated battery life–“up to 10
hours”–which suggests that the company thinks that shooting for
anything in excess of that would be wasted effort.</p>

<p>That 2010 iPad weighed a pound and a half, and felt a bit hefty in
the hand. With 2013’s iPad Air, Apple whittled that down to about
a pound. And there the mid-sized iPads have stayed,
weight-reduction mission accomplished.</p>

<p>However, when it comes to the iPad’s display, Apple has never been
satisfied to rest on its technological laurels.</p>

	<summary type="text">I do know that Schiller’s hard-charging, brusque style and his obvious political acumen have made him a lot of enemies over the years. It sounds like Fadell is one of them.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15782200/one-device-secret-history-iphone-brian-merchant-book-excerpt">The Verge has an exclusive (and lengthy) excerpt</a> from Brian Merchant&#8217;s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LWRN0KI/">The One Device: The Secret History of the iPhone</a></em>, which comes out next week. Merchant seemingly has many first-hand sources on the record, including Tony Fadell and perhaps Scott Forstall. (I say &#8220;perhaps&#8221; because it&#8217;s not clear from the excerpt whether Forstall spoke to Merchant, or if Merchant got the Forstall quotes from somewhere else. It seems like there should be a <em>lot</em> more from Forstall in this story if he actually talked to Merchant.)</p>

<p>But Fadell spoke to Merchant extensively, including this shot at Phil Schiller:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The iPod phone was losing support. The executives debated which
project to pursue, but Phil Schiller, Apple’s head of marketing,
had an answer: Neither. He wanted a keyboard with hard buttons.
The BlackBerry was arguably the first hit smartphone. It had an
email client and a tiny hard keyboard. After everyone else,
including Fadell, started to agree that multitouch was the way
forward, Schiller became the lone holdout.</p>

<p>He “just sat there with his sword out every time, going, ‘No,
we’ve got to have a hard keyboard. No. Hard keyboard.’ And he
wouldn’t listen to reason as all of us were like, ‘No, this works
now, Phil.’ And he’d say, ‘You gotta have a hard keyboard!’”
Fadell says.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s true or not that Schiller was singlehandedly pushing for a Blackberry-style keyboard. But even if true, it only looks foolish in hindsight, especially if this argument took place <em>before</em> the iPhone&#8217;s software team had come up with a proof-of-concept software keyboard. Today it&#8217;s clear that the iPhone needed a good keyboard, and that a touchscreen keyboard can be a good keyboard. Neither of those things was obvious in 2005. And in the context of this story, it&#8217;s clear that at the time of this purported argument, Steve Jobs and Apple weren&#8217;t yet sure if the iPhone should be a pocket-sized personal computer or a consumer electronics product that would have no more need for a keyboard (hardware or software) than an iPod did. My guess is that Schiller was insisting that the iPhone needed to be a personal computer, not a mere gadget, and it wasn&#8217;t unreasonable to believe a software keyboard wouldn&#8217;t be good enough. For chrissakes there were critics who insisted that the iPhone&#8217;s software keyboard wasn&#8217;t good enough for years <em>after</em> the iPhone actually shipped.</p>

<p>I do know that Schiller&#8217;s hard-charging, brusque style and his obvious political acumen have made him a lot of enemies over the years. It sounds like Fadell is one of them.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ll just say this: this story about Phil Schiller pushing for a hardware keyboard comes from one source (so far &#8212; if anyone out there can back that up, my window is always open for little birdies), and that one source is the guy who admittedly spent over a <em>year</em> working on iPhone prototypes with a click wheel interface.</p>

<p>Then there&#8217;s this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Schiller didn’t have the same technological acumen as many of the
other execs. “Phil is not a technology guy,” Brett Bilbrey, the
former head of Apple’s Advanced Technology Group, says. “There
were days when you had to explain things to him like a
grade-school kid.” Jobs liked him, Bilbrey thinks, because he
“looked at technology like middle America does, like Grandma and
Grandpa did.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hats off to Bilbrey for putting his name on this quote, but having spoken to Schiller both on- and off-the-record many times, the idea that he &#8220;looks at technology &#8230; like Grandma and Grandpa did&#8221; and needs things explained to him &#8220;like a grade-school kid&#8221; is bullshit. Especially off-the-record, Schiller can drill down on technical details to a surprising degree. I don&#8217;t know what Schiller did to piss off Bilbrey, but Bilbrey either has a huge chip on his shoulder or was severely misquoted by Merchant.<sup id="fnr1-2017-06-13-a"><a href="#fn1-2017-06-13">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Anyway, I sure wish this book excerpt had come out <em>before</em> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2017/06/08/ep-193">my live episode of The Talk Show last week</a> &#8212; now I <em>do</em> have one more question I wish I&#8217;d gotten to ask Schiller.</p>

Bilbrey headed Apple&#8217;s Technology Advancement Group. Merchant describes Bilbrey as having led &#8220;Apple’s Advanced Technology Group&#8221;. It&#8217;s a small detail, and the names are clearly similar, but the Advanced Technology Group was Larry Tesler&#8217;s R&D division at Apple, from 1986-1997.

	<summary type="text">The new iPad Pro hardware is almost too good to be true, but the real iPad story Apple unveiled last week is iOS 11.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>I’ve spent the last week using a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, and this is, in many ways, the easiest product review I’ve ever written. There are several significant improvements to the hardware, and <em>no</em> tradeoffs or downsides. There is no “<em>but</em>”.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Display:</strong> The new iPad Pros have the best displays of any computer I’ve ever seen. True Tone plus ProMotion is simply terrific. (The first generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro didn’t have True Tone; with these new models, the only noticeable difference between the 12.9- and 10.5-inch models is the size.) You really do have to see the 120 Hz refresh rate in person &#8212; and play with it while scrolling content on screen &#8212; to get it. You can actually read text as it’s moving during a scroll. It’s not as significant as the jump from non-retina to retina, but it’s in that ballpark.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pencil:</strong> The latency of the Apple Pencil on a first-generation iPad Pro is the best I had ever seen for any stylus on any device at any price. The latency of the Apple Pencil on the new iPad Pro is so much better &#8212;  so much closer to ink-on-paper imperceptibility &#8212; that you have to try it to believe it. It’s the one thing that really makes the first-gen iPad Pro feel &#8220;slow&#8221;.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Size:</strong> The increase in size is perfect. The footprint for a “regular” iPad has, until now, remained unchanged since the original iPad in 2010. That 9.7-inch display size was nearly perfect. This 10.5-inch display size is better though. Apple said during the keynote that typing on the on-screen keyboard is surprisingly better given just a bit more room, and I agree. And typing on the Smart Keyboard cover is <em>way</em> better than on last year’s 9.7-inch iPad Pro. In hand it doesn’t feel bigger at all. It feels like there were no trade-offs whatsoever in increasing the display size and overall device footprint. Part of that is because the weight has remained completely unchanged. I have had zero problems &#8212; not one &#8212; with the decreased bezel area. Apple’s inadvertent touch detection game is on point.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Battery:</strong> Battery life is great, as expected.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Performance:</strong> Apple’s in-house chip team continues to amaze. No one buys an iPad because of CPU benchmarks, but the new iPad Pro’s CPU performance is mind-boggling. Forget about comparisons to the one-port MacBook &#8212; the iPad Pro blows that machine out of the water performance-wise. The astounding thing is that the new iPad Pro holds its own against the MacBook <em>Pro</em> in single-core performance &#8212; around 3,900 on the Geekbench 4 benchmark for the iPad Pro vs. around 4,200–4,400 for the various configurations of 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pros.<sup id="fnr1-2017-06-12"><a href="#fn1-2017-06-12">1</a></sup> Multi-core performance has effectively <em>doubled</em> from the first generation of iPad Pro. That sort of year-over-year increase just doesn’t happen anymore, but here we are. The new iPad Pro gets a multi-core Geekbench 4 score of around 9200; the brand-new Core M3-based MacBook gets a multi-core score of around 6800. Again, this isn’t why people buy iPads &#8212; the iPad took off like a rocket in 2010 back when it was way slower (<em>way way way</em> slower) than even the slowest MacBook &#8212; but I think it is vastly underappreciated just how significantly Apple’s chip team is pulling ahead of the industry, especially Intel.<sup id="fnr2-2017-06-12"><a href="#fn2-2017-06-12">2</a></sup></p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>All that said, the real story of these new iPad Pro models can’t be told today, because that story is iOS 11. I think iOS 11’s iPad-focused features are the entire reason why Apple waited until WWDC to unveil them. They could have held an event for them back in April, when they released the new starting-at-just-$329 9.7-inch iPad, but if they did, the only new software they could have demoed was Clips. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/03/21/new-apple-stuff">I love Clips</a>, but it’s just a fun little tool and doesn’t show off anything particular to iPad compared to iPhone.</p>

<p>Again, the new iPad Pro hardware is almost too good to be true, but the iPad story Apple unveiled last week is iOS 11.</p>

<p>It’s not fair to review a product running a developer beta of the OS &#8212; let alone the <em>first</em> (and generally buggiest) beta. So let’s stop the “review” right here: the new iPad Pros running iOS 10.3.2 are the best iPads ever made. You shouldn’t hesitate to buy one today, and if you do get one now, you <em>should</em> wait until iOS 11 ships in the fall to upgrade, or at the very least wait for a non-developer public beta of iOS 11 this summer before upgrading.</p>

<p>But if you are reckless enough to install the iOS 11 beta on the new iPad Pro? Holy smokes is this better. I used the iPad Pro for a full week with iOS 10.3.2 because that’s the product that’s shipping, but after upgrading to iOS 11 beta 1 this morning and using it to write this entire review,<sup id="fnr3-2017-06-12"><a href="#fn3-2017-06-12">3</a></sup> I’m just blown away by how much more useful this machine is, and how much easier it is to work with 5 or 6 apps at a time.</p>

<p>I would never recommend running a beta of any OS on any device that’s used for production purposes, so don’t take this as such, but for me personally, I can’t see going back to iOS 10.3.2 on any iPad that can handle it. It feels like a hand has been untied from behind my back, and this amazing hardware has finally been allowed to run free.</p>

<p>Apple&#8217;s A10X chip is so high-performing that I think it&#8217;s put Apple in a slightly uncomfortable position marketing-wise.

I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a coincidence that the most impressive iPad demo during the keynote (and the one that contained the most bragging about its performance compared to PCs) was done by a third-party developer &#8212; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu59W1Pmq0U">Ash Hewson of Serif, demonstrating Affinity Photo</a> &#8212; not Greg Joswiak or anyone else from Apple.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2017-06-12"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/@johnnylin/how-to-make-80-000-per-month-on-the-apple-app-store-bdb943862e88">Great investigative piece by Johnny Lin looking</a> into a top-10 highest grossing app named &#8220;Mobile protection :Clean &amp; Security VPN&#8221; (punctuation and grammatical errors <em>sic</em>), from a developer named Ngan Vo Thi Thuy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Full Virus, Malware scanner”: What? I’m pretty sure it’s
impossible for any app to scan my iPhone for viruses or malware,
since third party apps are sandboxed to their own data, but let’s
keep reading…</p>

<p>“You will pay $99.99 for a 7-day subscription”</p>

<p>Uhh… come again?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There should be <em>no</em> &#8220;virus and malware&#8221; scanners in the App Store. None. iOS does not need anti-virus software. The App Store sandboxing rules mean that anti-virus software couldn&#8217;t really do anything useful anyway. And by allowing them to be listed on the store, it creates the false impression that Apple thinks you <em>might</em> need anti-virus software.</p>

<p>But do-nothing anti-virus utilities that are scamming people into $100/week subscriptions? That&#8217;s downright criminal.</p>

<p>Lin shows that &#8220;Mobile protection :Clean &amp; Security VPN&#8221; is not alone. The productivity top-grossing list is riddled with similar scam apps. </p>

<p>Given how many legitimate developers are still having problems getting their apps approved due to seemingly capricious App Store reviewer decisions, it&#8217;s doubly outrageous that these apps have made their way onto the store in the first place. These are the <em>exact</em> sort of apps that the App Store review process should be primarily looking to block.</p>

<p>And there is no excuse for Apple not having flagged them after the fact, once they started generating significant revenue. It&#8217;s downright mind boggling that this horrendous &#8220;Mobile protection :Clean &amp; Security VPN&#8221; app made it all the way into the top 10 without getting flagged.</p>

<p>Based on Lin&#8217;s research, the pattern is simple:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a scammy utility app and get it into the store. Make it a free download with an expensive in-app subscription.</li>
<li>Bid on common keywords like &#8220;virus&#8221;, &#8220;VPN&#8221;, and &#8220;wi-fi&#8221;.</li>
<li>Get tens of thousands of downloads thanks to the top-of-results placement from the ad.</li>
<li>Spring the in-app subscription prompt on your users and make money with a response rate of even just a fraction of 1 percent.</li>
</ol>

<p>Apple needs to remove these apps from the App Store, and prevent such apps from getting into the store in the first place. They should reconsider the effects of allowing developers to buy their way to the top spot in search results. And they should police the top-grossing lists for apps that are pulling scams &#8212; the most important scams to catch are the successful ones.</p>

<p>Lastly, every single dollar these apps have generated should be refunded to the victims of these scams.</p>

	<summary type="text">The next batch of tickets will go on sale today, Friday, at 1p ET/10a PT. Given what happened Wednesday, I expect them to sell out in a few minutes.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>On Wednesday I put the first 500 tickets on sale for next week&#8217;s live show from WWDC. They sold out in 7 minutes.</p>

<p>The California Theatre in San Jose has both an orchestra level and a balcony. That first bunch of tickets separated the two. After talking with the staff at the theater today, they recommended making all tickets general admission and allowing their ushers to fill the orchestra level first, and then direct remaining ticket holders to the balcony. So, all tickets, including those sold Wednesday, are now simply general admission. Everyone paid the same price, so I think this is fair, but I do apologize for any confusion. The theater is beautiful, and there are no bad seats.</p>

<p>The next batch of tickets <a href="https://ti.to/daringfireball/the-talk-show-WWDC-2017/">will go on sale today, Friday, at 1p ET/10a PT</a>. Given what happened Wednesday, I expect them to sell out in a few minutes. I hate writing that because it sounds braggy, but I&#8217;m putting it out there just as fair warning. You&#8217;re going to have to act quick and maybe get lucky.</p>

<p>If you want a ticket and wind up not getting one, there will be a live audio stream for everyone to listen to. This year we are not going to attempt to stream live video. Instead we&#8217;re going to work hard to get edited video of the event up on the web as soon as possible after the show is over. If you just can&#8217;t wait, listen to the live audio. If you want to <em>see</em> the show, wait for the video &#8212; it should be up some time on Wednesday at the latest.</p>

<p>If you do get a ticket or already have one:</p>

<ul>
<li>All seats are general admission, with no distinction between orchestra level and the balcony.</li>
<li>Put your ticket in Apple Wallet and bring ID to show at the door. (If you don&#8217;t have an iPhone (?) bring a copy of the ticket PDF.)</li>
<li>Doors open at 6p, and there will be an open bar. Find a seat, grab a beverage, and mingle with your fellow fans of the show.</li>
<li>The show itself should start at 7p.</li>
</ul>
