            "content_html": "<p>Sarah Perez, <em>TechCrunch</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Marketing Onavo within Facebook itself could lead to a boost in users for the VPN app, which promises to warn users of malicious websites and keep information secure \u2013 like bank account and credit card numbers \u2013 as you browse. But Facebook didn\u2019t buy Onavo for its security protections.</p>\n  \n  <p>Instead, Onavo\u2019s VPN allow Facebook to monitor user activity across apps, giving Facebook a big advantage in terms of spotting new trends across the larger mobile ecosystem. For example, Facebook gets an early heads up about apps that\u00a0are becoming breakout hits; it can tell which are seeing slowing user growth; it sees which apps\u2019 new features appear to be resonating with their users, and much more.</p>\n  \n  <p>This data has already helped Facebook in a number of ways, most notably in its battle with Snapchat. At The WSJ reported last August, Facebook could tell that Instagram\u2019s launch of Stories \u2013 a Snapchat-like feature \u2013 was working to slow Snapchat\u2019s user growth, before the company itself even publicly disclosed this fact.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Think about that: Facebook has one of the largest platforms in the world, and is using that influence to promote a service <em>that they control</em> to spot and preemptively eliminate potential competitors. The reason they\u2019re able to do all of these things is because of their size and dominance.</p>\n\n<p>I understand the reluctance by many regulators and industry observers to say that Facebook ought to be broken up into smaller, unaffiliated companies, but I\u2019m struggling to see many other ways to keep the company\u2019s influence in check. Largely ignoring it, as has been done so far, is bad for competition. Even if you ignore potential anticompetitive issues, there\u2019s still a question of whether users of Facebook\u2019s VPN are adequately aware of how the company accessed and uses their data.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pxlnv.com/linklog/facebook-vpn-protect/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent link to 'Under the Guise of Security, Facebook is Promoting Their VPN in Their iOS App'\" class=\"glyph\">&#9673;</a></p>\n",

It\u2019s a framework for developers to create faster-loading mobile content on the web. Beyond simply loading pages faster, AMP now supports building a wide range of rich pages for the web. Today, we\u2019re announcing AMP for Email so that emails can be formatted and sent as AMP documents. As a part of this, we\u2019re also kicking off the Gmail Developer Preview of AMP for Email \u2014 so once you\u2019ve built your emails, you\u2019ll be able to test them in Gmail.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not content with bifurcating the web with the introduction of a proprietary HTML-like webpage format, Google is now trying to split email clients into Gmail and everybody else. Gmail is already an <a href=\"https://marco.org/2013/11/04/mavericks-gmail\">email-like product</a> and has some of the worst CSS support of mainstream email clients.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, there\u2019s a good chance the advanced capabilities of this format won\u2019t catch on because email clients are already pretty fragmented as things stand today. It\u2019s an area of the web where the lowest common denominators \u2014 HTML tables and old-school tags like <code>&lt;font&gt;</code> \u2014 are used with disturbing regularity, simply because it\u2019s the <em>only</em> markup that works well in all clients. It\u2019s frustrating enough to build emails as things are; I imagine many developers will reject this because it adds yet another layer of complexity to their workflow that may not be used by a large number of recipients.</p>\n\n<p>Developers shouldn\u2019t reject this on those grounds alone, however. Google\u2019s increasing demands to bend open formats with proprietary variations is a fantastic reason to avoid AMP in email messages.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pxlnv.com/linklog/amp-for-email/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent link to 'Google Announces AMP For Email Spec'\" class=\"glyph\">&#9673;</a></p>\n",

Instead of keeping engineers on a relentless annual schedule and cramming features into a single update, Apple will start focusing\u00a0on the next two years of updates\u00a0for its iPhone and iPad operating system, according to people familiar with the change.\u00a0The company will continue to update its software annually,\u00a0but internally engineers will have more discretion to push back features that aren&#8217;t as polished to the following year.\u00a0</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The biggest news here is that Apple is reportedly adjusting their internal processes to try to reduce the demands of an annual update. But I\u2019m not sure how much will change externally because this sounds a lot like the way they presently release iOS updates: still a focus on new features in the autumn, with some features debuting later in that major version\u2019s release cycle. Apple Pay Cash, for instance, was announced at WWDC in June with the implication that it would be release with iOS 11.0, but it wasn\u2019t launched until November with iOS 11.2.</p>\n\n<p>If the changes are as modest as this report makes them out to be, how much of an improvement can we realistically expect in software quality?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pxlnv.com/linklog/gurman-apple-development-cycle/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent link to 'Apple Reportedly Focusing Less on Monolithic Annual iOS Updates'\" class=\"glyph\">&#9673;</a></p>\n",

So, if you know someone who works at, say, Apple, or you have the Transit app installed, you will find yourself regularly undoing the automatic capitalization of those words when talking about fruit or the very concept of public transit.

This is when code is overwrought, unorganized, opaque, and snarled with dependencies. I perked up when I heard the term used for the first time, because, while I can\u2019t identify spaghetti code as a designer, I sure as hell know about spaghetti workflows and spaghetti toolchains. It feels like we\u2019re there now on the web.</p>\n  \n  <p>[\u2026]</p>\n  \n  <p>I wonder what young designers think of this situation and how they are educating themselves in a complicated field. How do they learn if the code is illegible? Does it seem like more experienced people are pulling up the ladder of opportunity by doing this? Twenty years ago, I decided to make my own website, because I saw an example of HTML and I could read it. Many of my design peers are the same. We possess skills to make websites, but we stopped there. We stuck with markup and never progressed into full-on programming, because we were only willing to go as far as things were legible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This essay resonated deeply with me. I wrote my first line of HTML about twenty years ago. I remember editing the Yahoo homepage in Netscape Composer around that time, and building a Geocities website not that long after. It felt easy and approachable, even if <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> syntax was often inscrutable and unpredictable. A few years later, the CSS wave hit the web and I learned about why it was appropriate to separate presentational code from the page&#8217;s markup.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> CSS has become more complicated since then, but it continues to make sense to me, even though I need to look up the flexbox syntax every time I use it.</p>\n\n<p>Over the last five years or so, even the most basic website stopped being treated as a collection of documents and started being thought of as software. Over the same period of time, I have gone from thinking that I know how to build a website quickly and efficiently to having absolutely no clue where to start learning about <em>any</em> of this stuff. I can&#8217;t imagine being eight years old again and being interested in the web as something <em>anyone</em> can contribute to.</p>\n\n<p><b>See Also:</b> Chimero&#8217;s spoken, longer-form version of this essay, given as a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqYPD7yf4fA\">talk at Mirror Conf</a>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>And, yet, the easiest way to make a few boxes side-by-side that have the same resulting height despite allowing a flexible amount of text in each remains <code>display: table-cell</code>. The same technique allows perhaps the easiest way to vertically centre an unpredictable amount of text. Like tables for layout purposes, it still isn&#8217;t semantically correct, but we use it anyway.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" rev=\"footnote\">&#8617;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://pxlnv.com/linklog/everything-easy-is-hard-again/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent link to 'Everything Easy is Hard Again'\" class=\"glyph\">&#9673;</a></p>\n",

To be fair to Topolsky, he may sincerely believe that there&#8217;s value in challenging the assumption that these products are well-designed, and I think that&#8217;s completely reasonable. It&#8217;s that article&#8217;s companion piece, \u201c<a href=\"https://theoutline.com/post/2388/google-is-really-good-at-design\">Google is Really Good at Design</a>\u201d, that occasionally creeps up in my mind.</p>\n\n<p>Topolsky:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The concepts inherent in Material Design \u2014 a system of literal layers that evoke the tactility of a stack of paper, but offers the flexibility of digital spaces; a responsive layout concept that assumes no two devices may be exactly the same size or shape; a bold use of typography, motion, and color \u2014 showcase a decidedly different approach than Apple has taken. Where Jony Ive and company have produced a scattered, visually unmoored solution that seems to be solving small problems bite-by-bite, Google essentially blew up what had come before and reset. This radical rethink has spread into Google&#8217;s deep web pockets, meaning that a logical system of navigation and connectivity not only informs what you see on your phone when you interact with apps and services, but what you get on the web, on a laptop, or on a TV. Gmail is Gmail is Gmail, responding to whatever screen it\u2019s on. And sometimes, thanks to Google\u2019s deep machine learning and natural language chops, Gmail is also the disembodied voice you talk to while you\u2019re driving. In Google\u2019s universe, its voice-activated Assistant isn\u2019t middleware \u2014 it\u2019s <em>everyware</em>, tapping deeply and natively into all of the company\u2019s nodes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Topolsky is generally right in saying that Google&#8217;s approach to user interfaces is remarkably consistent across everything, but I would argue that it represents why their products are often so frustrating and cumbersome to use.</p>\n\n<p>Case in point: their <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/02/07/apple-tv-youtube-app-redesign/\">new YouTube app for tvOS</a>. The last version didn&#8217;t represent a dramatic design statement or look particularly special \u2014 it was pretty much the same as any of the default tvOS apps \u2014 but it worked, for the most part. It was the only app I&#8217;ve used on my Apple TV that would regularly kick me back to the tvOS home screen instead of the last screen in the app when I pressed the remote&#8217;s menu button while watching a video, and it had stability problems when searching, but it wasn&#8217;t terrible.</p>\n\n<p>The new app, though, represents everything wrong with Google&#8217;s present UI design philosophy. It follows virtually none of the Apple TV platform conventions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>There&#8217;s a sidebar on the left that looks like an <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/design/patterns/actionbar.html\">Android action bar</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Swiping to the left on the touch pad from any of the app&#8217;s menu screens will open a main menu panel, with navigation options for your subscriptions, video history, and own video library.</p></li>\n<li><p>There&#8217;s also a horizontal navigation element, similar to the type that you would find in a default tvOS app.</p></li>\n<li><p>None of these elements behaves as you might expect, primarily because the YouTube app doesn&#8217;t interpret swipes and scrolls like any other app. There&#8217;s no audible <em>blip</em> whenever you select something, and swiping around manages to be both sluggish and jerky.</p>\n\n<p>The frustratingly slow scrolling is especially pronounced on the aforementioned horizontal navigation element because swiping just a little too far to the left will open the modal main menu panel that covers a third of the screen.</p>\n\n<p>The slow scrolling is also apparent in the main menu panel. The scrolling &#8220;friction&#8221;, for lack of a better term, is such that swiping down just a little is unlikely to have any effect, and swiping down just a little bit more will move the selector down two menu items. It can be very difficult to get it to move one menu item at a time.</p></li>\n<li><p>There&#8217;s no sense of transition between screens or states. Instead of fading, screens simply change; instead of smoothly sliding left or right when scrolling across thumbnails, there will often be a sudden jump to load the new set of thumbnails.</p></li>\n<li><p>Swiping horizontally across the remote while a video is playing will scrub the video. This is something Apple <a href=\"https://www.cultofmac.com/420160/scrub-through-video-on-apple-tv-in-tvos-9-2/\">quickly changed</a> after the fourth-generation Apple TV debuted because of how easy it was to accidentally invoke it.</p></li>\n<li><p>Tapping on the remote&#8217;s touch pad to display onscreen controls automatically selects the play/pause button instead of the scrubber, as in other tvOS apps, and there are two levels of controls in the custom player.</p></li>\n<li><p>The app is also an ugly sea of mid-tone greys.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It isn&#8217;t unheard-of for an Apple TV app from a major third party to fail to adhere to platform conventions. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/06/amazon-prime-video-app-for-apple-tv/\">Amazon Prime app</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/justin/status/938521329526902784\">doesn&#8217;t look or behave</a> anything like a native app because it&#8217;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/938579246015971329\">basically a web app</a>. Hulu and Netflix also have some pretty crappy apps that don&#8217;t really function like a tvOS app ought to.</p>\n\n<p>But this also isn&#8217;t unlike Google, which has completely disregarded platform standards with their major iOS apps for years. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with making apps of a particular style \u2014 my favourite developers all have their unique quirks and styles that help identify their apps as <em>theirs</em> \u2014 but Google&#8217;s apps frequently feel less like they&#8217;re trying to create branded iOS apps and more like they want their Android apps to run on iOS.</p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3075537/ios/google-is-making-the-same-mistake-now-that-microsoft-did-in-the-90s.html\">isn&#8217;t a new argument</a>, and Google has become a moderately better citizen on iOS over the past couple of years: their sharing glyph now looks like the system standard one instead of lazily copying the shape they use on Android, for example. This new YouTube app for tvOS is a step back, however. It feels like a half-assed port. When there&#8217;s no clear effort by a huge company like Google to even <em>try</em> to make their products fit a different platform, it indicates a lack of care and attention to detail. It also demonstrates that users&#8217; expectations and learned behaviours are less important than self-promotion and branding.</p>\n\n<p>What it shows, ultimately, is a lack of consideration for design.</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>Reviews of the HomePod are going live across the web this morning ahead of its release this Friday, and it seems like it&#8217;s living up to what was promised: a very good speaker with extraordinary audio engineering and limited Siri capabilities.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/nicolenguyen/homepod-review\">Nicole Nguyen</a>, <em>Buzzfeed</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[Kate Bergeron, vice president of hardware engineering,] was speaking to a small group of tech bloggers, including myself, last Monday in Apple\u2019s Cupertino, CA-based audio lab, just minutes from the new Apple Park spaceship campus. About six years ago, according to Bergeron, the company began working on HomePod by attempting to answer this question: \u201cWhat if we decided to design a loudspeaker that we could put in any room, and it wouldn\u2019t affect the sound?\u201d</p>\n  \n  <p>This question is very different from the question the Amazon Echo and Google Home are trying to address. Those speakers\u2019 primary aim is to offer hands-free help, by way of turning on the lights in the living room, telling you what traffic to work is like, setting timers, and playing podcasts while you\u2019re busy cooking breakfast.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/06/a-four-sentence-homepod-review-with-appendices/\">Matthew Panzarino</a>, <em>TechCrunch</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The sound that comes from the HomePod can best be described as precise. It\u2019s not as loud as some others like Google Home Max or as bright (and versatile) as the Sonos Play 1, but it destroys the muddy sound of less sophisticated options like the Amazon Echo. To genuinely fill a large room you need two but anyone in a small house or apartment will get great sound from one.</p>\n  \n  <p>[\u2026]</p>\n  \n  <p>While you can send texts and take notes and set reminders and handle phone calls begun on your iPhone, that\u2019s about all of the extracurriculars and they\u2019re all focused on single-user experiences. If you\u2019re logged in to your iCloud account, all of the messages and calls are yours and come from you. That\u2019s great if you\u2019re a single dude living alone, but it completely falls apart in a family environment. Apple allows you to toggle these options off as the iCloud account owner and I recommend you do before it all ends in tears. Unless you live alone in which case Mazel, it sounds peaceful.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t.co/bhtbJHHfoR\">Joanna Stern</a>, <em>Wall Street Journal</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are other problems I won\u2019t shut up about: Many people will put a HomePod in the kitchen, yet it can\u2019t set two simultaneous cooking timers. It can\u2019t wake me up to \u201cWake Me Up Before You Go-Go,\u201d either. Echo and Google Home can do both. Apple says it is improving Siri all the time.</p>\n  \n  <p>[\u2026]</p>\n  \n  <p>Siri turns out to be quite a good butler. Through the Home app, you can set up various HomeKit-compatible smart-home devices, and the voice prompts to control them. With Philips Hue lightbulbs and three iHome smart plugs, I was quickly commanding Siri to change my nightlight to a fuchsia hue, make tea via my electric kettle and turn on the humidifier.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bxchen/status/960874882400595968\">Brian X.</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bxchen/status/960882152505094144\">Chen</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Most bizarre thing about HomePod: It didn\u2019t play music relevant to my listening history or prefs when asked \u201cHey Siri, Play some music.\u201d</p>\n  \n  <p>Siri should be better on HomePod because it\u2019s the primary way to control it. But yeah, it\u2019s worse.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a mistake to question whether Siri&#8217;s lacklustre abilities will be a hindrance to the success of the HomePod. Apple may be positioning it as a great speaker first and a smart speaker second, and the market will get to tell them whether that&#8217;s a reasonable way to judge the product. And, perhaps, people will love it for a speaker alone \u2014 it&#8217;s clearly a very good one. The more damning thing to consider about Siri is not that it is poor on the HomePod, but that it is poor <em>everywhere</em>. Fortunately, software can be updated, so that just means that we need to see some commitment from Apple that Siri is a high priority.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pxlnv.com/linklog/homepod-review-roundup/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent link to 'HomePod Review Roundup'\" class=\"glyph\">&#9673;</a></p>\n",

Pai wasn&#8217;t elevated from commissioner to chairman until <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/01/fcc-to-be-led-by-ajit-pai-staunch-opponent-of-consumer-protection-rules/\">January 2017</a>, and he didn&#8217;t lead the vote to repeal the net neutrality rules until <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/goodbye-net-neutrality-ajit-pais-fcc-votes-to-allow-blocking-and-throttling/\">December 2017</a>. And, technically, those rules are still on the books because the repeal won&#8217;t take effect for at least another two months.</p>\n  \n  <p>The timing means that it would be impossible for Pai to present evidence today that broadband deployment is increasing as a result of the net neutrality repeal. But the report claims that&#8217;s exactly what happened anyway and says that future data will bear that out. To support its argument, the report claims that broadband deployment projects that were started during the Obama administration were somehow caused by Pai&#8217;s deregulatory policies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not only are they counting Obama-era \u2014 and net neutrality-era \u2014 investment plans as evidence of improved broadband deployment thanks to rules friendly to giant ISPs, they&#8217;re also citing past investments that have since been curtailed due to policies implemented by this FCC administration. That&#8217;s some bullshit anti-consumer behaviour.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pxlnv.com/linklog/pai-cites-obama-broadband-investments/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent link to 'Ajit Pai\u2019s FCC Cites Obama-Era Broadband Investments'\" class=\"glyph\">&#9673;</a></p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>Michael Simon, <em>Macworld</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-music-on-track-to-overtake-spotify-in-u-s-subscribers-1517745720\">The Wall Street Journal</a>, Apple is on track to overtake Spotify in U.S. paid subscribers, a sign that the three-year-old music service is making serious inroads in a highly competitive landscape. The report states that Apple Music has been gaining U.S. subscribers at a 3 percent higher clip than Spotify, a trend that would give Apple&#8217;s music service a higher subscriber rate by the summer, assuming it continues.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That\u2019s terrific news for Apple Music, especially considering that it is only available as a paid service. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if many users are paying more for music now than they have for a long time. You might think \u2014 quite reasonably, I believe \u2014 that this indicates that Apple\u2019s strategy is working well.</p>\n\n<p>But not Simon:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With a free Apple Music tier, Apple would not only get music fans to flock to its service in droves, it could also use it as a way to advertise HomePod as the best way to listen to Apple Music at home and AirPods as the ultimate on-the-go solution. With quick ads between songs, it would be speaking directly to a captive audience who shares a love for music. Simply put, there&#8217;s no better way to advertise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Without trying to predict the future, I don\u2019t think this fits the existing Apple Music strategy. The HomePod\u2019s integration is clearly best with Apple Music, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a reason to provide a free tier; the free trial more aptly demonstrates the advantages of subscribing to Apple Music.</p>\n\n<p>More than anything, I think Simon falls into the same trap many others do: Apple isn\u2019t setting out to build the biggest user base, but a large <em>paying</em> user base. A free trial accomplishes that goal; a free tier does not.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pxlnv.com/linklog/apple-music-growing-faster-than-spotify/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent link to 'In the U.S., Apple Music is Growing Faster Than Spotify in Paid Users'\" class=\"glyph\">&#9673;</a></p>\n",

Meanwhile the CFPB has shelved plans for on-the-ground tests of how Equifax protects data, an idea backed by Cordray.</p>\n  \n  <p>The CFPB also recently rebuffed bank regulators at the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency when they offered to help with on-site exams of credit bureaus, said two sources familiar with the matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>An investigation of this size and scope will, of course, take lots of time and may not always take a linear direction, but there should never be a question about whether it is proceeding at all. Consumers should never have to wonder whether the Bureau is operating in their best interests, especially given the impact of the Equifax breach on virtually every American adult with a credit card, mortgage, or car.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pxlnv.com/linklog/cfpb-equifax-investigation-on-ice/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent link to 'Reuters: CFPB Investigation Into Equifax \u2018Put on Ice\u2019'\" class=\"glyph\">&#9673;</a></p>\n",
