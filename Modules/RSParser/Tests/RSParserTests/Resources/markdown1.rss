			<title>WordPress and AI</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I see that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2025/05/announcing-the-formation-of-the-wordpress-ai-team/&quot;&gt;WordPress world&lt;/a&gt; is getting interested in adding AI features. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had some &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/09/28/132152.html&quot;&gt;ideas&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/07/12/134525.html&quot;&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/03/20/151234.html&quot;&gt;years&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/05/15.html&quot;&gt;ago&lt;/a&gt;, about how I would like AI to be hooked up to blogging, and the ideas have developed a bit in the years since. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As a writer I want most is every bit of writing I’ve published turned into any kind of book I want at any time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think it’s a great time to invest in new ideas for writers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt; I have pretty good &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22still%20diggin%22&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; on my blog, but so much more is possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An example of a book lurking in the archive of my blog. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A user’s guide to FeedLand.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Knowing the AI would pull a users manual together on command, I’d feel more comfortable writing about it on my blog. As it is there’s a lot of good info between other blog posts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Imagine a series of book types you could ask your AI friend to build for you from your own writing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Eventually all user's guides will be assembled by AI. In the case of software products it should have already happened, though I'm just as behind the curve as everyone else is in this regard. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt; And of course the first docs to be produced that way would be &lt;em&gt;A user's guide to WordPress.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>wpIdentity work to warm up</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As a warmup project, I've updated the home page of the wpidentity package, so that it's clear that it's much more than identity. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Did the final editing on the api2.js file -- so that all the code is separated from the assignment to the wordpress object.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Next up I want to generate a set of docs for the function. I've tried it with ChatGPT before and it seemed to do a pretty good job, this time I'll look more closely.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to see if I can quickly write a &quot;hello world&quot; scale editor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Reading lists in FeedLand via Gemini</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Generated by Gemini, better docs than anything we had.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In FeedLand, a reading list is a list of feeds you can subscribe to as a group. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can subscribe to a reading list by finding its URL and entering it in the &quot;Subscribe to reading lists&quot; tool within FeedLand. When the author of the reading list adds or removes a feed, all subscribers are automatically updated, which is a convenient way to stay current with a curated collection of content. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;How to use a reading list&lt;/h4&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Find the reading list URL: The reading list will have a unique URL, often shared by the author or influencer.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Subscribe in FeedLand: Go to your instance of FeedLand and look for a tool like &quot;Subscribe to reading lists.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Enter the URL: Paste the URL of the reading list into the provided field.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Stay updated: FeedLand will automatically add the feeds from the list to your subscriptions. You will be notified when the list changes, and your subscriptions will be updated accordingly. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Key features&lt;/h4&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;• Curated content: Reading lists allow users to get a curated collection of feeds from a single source, making it easy to discover new content. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt; • Automatic updates: When the author of a reading list adds or removes a feed, all subscribers are automatically updated. • Duplicate handling: FeedLand has a feature to prevent a feed from appearing more than once in your list, even if it is both directly subscribed to and part of a reading list.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the concept of reading lists in FeedLand, you can read this article from FeedLand blog (https://feedland.blog/page/3/) that explains the feature in more detail. You can also explore the FeedLand API documentation on the FeedLand website (https://feedland.blog/2023/11/) to learn how to interact with reading lists programmatically.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>What I did on my trip to Canada, part 1</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I presented &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt; for the first time publicly, the new one with a timeline, so it more clearly shows how we can build a beautiful social network just from open formats and protocols. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt; No user lock-in, every part replaceable, and open to developers to add functionality without having to reimplement the whole thing. These are all the things I think that have stood in the way of innovation in the web for many years. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A social network that starts out with no centralization and is open in every sense has a much better chance of being decentralized than one that starts out centralized and swears they're going to stop doing that -- someday, fingers crossed, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Matt Mullenweg photo at WordCamp Canada</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm back at &lt;a href=&quot;https://canada.wordcamp.org/2025/&quot;&gt;WordCamp&lt;/a&gt; in a big room &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg&quot;&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/a&gt; to answer questions for the people here. Yesterday's presentation went really well, lots of smart people really interested, fantastic discussion after. A very nice web culture. I went with three slides to get started, and then talked, demo'd, answered questions, and listened to ideas. Told a few jokes. Got a few laughs. It got the job done, help feed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word-of-mouth_marketing&quot;&gt;word of mouth&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://daveverse.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/matt.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Times I've been ambushed at conferences</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I think I'm done. I've got the outline for the slides complete. I can't possibly talk about all the stuff that's in the slides. Once I leave tomorrow I think perhaps I'll post a link for the slides and maybe offer a place to comment. Maybe. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I get very nervous about these things and then remember when I've prepared as much as I have for this, the talk goes quickly and people generally are nice, though I've been ambushed a few memorable times. Let's see -- Austin, Cambridge, San Francisco and Nashville come to mind. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In Austin it was because I was privileged. I was being honored because it was the 25th year of my blog, and I was one of the keynoters. I told the promoter his people wouldn't like me, and then I forgot I said it when it happened. I was stuck, I didn't want to get into a public argument with anyone. (Had I wanted to rebut, I would have said everyone in this room is privileged, just look around at how well fed and educated everyone is. We all flew in here. We live in a rich country where we are the elite of the elite. Now STFU, in my dreams.) &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There have been times when I welcomed an argument...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In San Francisco, I was invited to lead a panel from the music industry about how great Napster was. This was probably in 2000 or 2001 when Napster was at its peak. It was an ambush. All the panelists made me the issue, and then they voted to kick me off the stage. I stayed there and waited until they exhausted their rage, and then asked them a question about music and Napster. Acted like nothing had happened. I had earned my place there, I was a very early industry adopter of Napster. I loved what it did for us. Imagine until then you either had to buy an album to listen to music, build a collection, or wait until it was played on the radio. (What is radio? Kind of an early form of podcasting.) People were talking about music in supermarkets and airports. This could not be stopped, I was sure of it, and they were acting like babies. I stood up and prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In Nashville, I was invited to be a sort of keynoter for a conference that was patterned after BloggerCon. I did not organize it, but I led a session, which was attended by a famous right wing blogger who I had invited to the Harvard BloggerCon. He brought a bunch of his friends, and they each said no one was listening to them but we were listening to them. I eventually sat down and let them have a session dominated by a few people repeating themselves. It was boring. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally I was set up by the promoters of a CMS conference which Berkman hosted at Harvard. I was the master of ceremonies. No one told me that one of my most virulent trolls was there, and when he got up to rage at me I asked him to sit down, but Charlie Nesson who was the senior educator there, and kind of naive about internet trolls, said he should speak his mind. I should have walked out at that point. I knew what was coming. It really shook me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In Nashville a columnist in the local paper who said I caused the riot, btw. I swear to god I always take my discussion leader role seriously.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>How to go fullscreen in Chrome on Mac</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I finally figured out how to make presentations full screen on the Mac. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm using Chrome to display the presentation. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Chrome's View menu turn off the first three options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choose Enter full screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voila -- full screen!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, neither Claude.ai or ChatGPT knew that Chrome has all the functionality needed to do this. The commands were in the same menu as the one command the both insisted would do it. So this human beat them both on something they really should’ve been much better at.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<source:markdown>I finally figured out how to make presentations full screen on the Mac.&#10;&#10;I'm using Chrome to display the presentation.&#10;&#10;1.  In Chrome's View menu turn off the first three options.&#10;&#10;2.  Choose Enter full screen.&#10;&#10;3.  Voila -- full screen!&#10;&#10;4.  Whew.&#10;&#10;BTW, neither Claude.ai or ChatGPT knew that Chrome has all the functionality needed to do this. The commands were in the same menu as the one command the both insisted would do it. So this human beat them both on something they really should’ve been much better at.</source:markdown>

			<title>Zeroing in on the editor</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Going through quick hits on my list, not taking chances of breaking core stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want a way to zero in on the editor and hide the timeline, so you can focus just on editing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't think I have the answer yet, but I do have a way of trying the idea out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A new command in the main menu entitled &lt;em&gt;Focus on editor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Not a great command name either.

			<title>Closing editor after publish pref</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Added a setting to close the editor after you publish. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is useful if you do a lot of linkblogging. Typically you don't edit the posts, because they go to systems that don't allow updates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Peace in our time? Hmm far from it.</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Just listened to NPR news and they're quoting people basting Trump with effusive praise for whatever just happened in Gaza and Israel. Well I haven't forgotten that Trump is deploying the military to Portland, Chicago and DC and probably everywhere else before too long. That he's threatened Canada's independence. He says Antifa is his enemy which (as a math major) I am happy to tell you means that he is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism&quot;&gt;fa&lt;/a&gt; in Antifa. He admits it. Thanks for that Uncle Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd also like to add that before you heap that much praise on Trump, remember that Netanyahu is a member of the Republican Party (yes I know officially he's part of Likud, but I've been paying attention to how little respect he had for Obama and Biden, he even went over Obama's head and addressed Congress on his own, which put him on my permanent shit list, What happened here is that Trump gave him an order as he does to other members of the Republican Party. They don't discuss these things, they just do them, because they are scared shitless of Trump and Stephen Miller. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One more thing, the history of the US and Israel is a long one, and there have been plenty of big moments when everyone said peace has finally come to the region, only to find out soon after that it hadn't. It's like celebrating your victory in the World Series when you haven't even made the playoffs yet. Be careful about declaring victory. In this case the odds are not good. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;NPR is, I guess, hoping to not get sent to the gulag when Trump decides it's time to clean up journalism in the US. I suppose we're all thinking that way to a certain extent, but that's also not a winning strategy imho.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>One place all your writing emanates from</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Idea to add to slides. The ideal is to write everything you’re going to publish anywhere in one place,  and distribute the text, or ideally pointers to the text to the places people want to read it. So you maintain the original text in one place. That can’t happen until there’s some basic agreement of what text is. This is something that was established in html, but since twitter the question has been much more of a challenge. Then there have to be APIs that allow full flow I. Both directions.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Web — no platform vendor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Covering all the bets haha</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I think we have all bets covered now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I post this to Daveverse it will show up immediately in the timeline. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And for good luck we also send a message to FeedLand to check it, so even if it doesn't get an rssCloud ping due to misconfiguration of the server, it will still show up if I reload the page, and on any other system that doesn't happen to be the authors. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Glad I investigated this now, would hate to have to work on it later, knowing how I had to insert calls into very sensitive parts of the system. Small pieces loosely joined require some time to burn in before inflicting it on innocent users. 😀&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's make an edit happen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>daveverse.org and rssCloud support</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I think perhaps the Daveverse server is not doing the rssCloud notifications for subscribers, because: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;when i publish something new to daveverse, feedland doesn't immediately check the feed, as it would if it were getting a rssCloud ping.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;the rssCloud mechanism appears to be working properly for wordpress.com-hosted sites, and for Scripting News and other sites that support rssCloud.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;i find that if i cause the check to happen in WordLand (something it can do because it can talk directly to the feedland server) i get the notification via websocket and the update happens in the timeline.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;note that daveverse.org is hosted on my own server, with help from Scott Hanson.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;since this is being posted on daveverse.org it serves as a test case for me to confirm some of the things i said here. ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

			<title>A good morning message</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Good morning Daveverse! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I learned something new today. Sometimes my keyboard stops working. Or one key stops working. I try turning it on and off. Usually fixes the problem. But today the Return key stopped working. I figured okay this keyboard is burned out, so I got one of my other supposedly burned out keyboards and swapped it in. Return key still doesn't work. Oh.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I tried quitting Chrome and relaunching it. And boom it works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Keep remembering sometimes it's a software error and sometimes it isn't your software that's misbehaving, probably.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;OK, so this is the acid test I am now trying to create a new post from my iPad and previously it wouldn’t have shown up in the timeline and now it should show up in the in the timeline and. And when I actually try it, we will see if it actually works or if it doesn’t in which case we will have to pick this up in the morning because it’s time for me to eat food and hang out and you know what I can’t work 24 hours a day I have to take most of the time to enjoy life and do things other than like torture myself by working and finding that there is a difference between HTTP and HTTPS and don’t ask me what it is because I don’t even know. Thank you very much. Have a nice day over and out your pal Dave. xxx&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>A relaxed baseball playoffs this year</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I plan to watch baseball tonight. We're at the climax of the first non wild-card round. The Phillies have been eliminated by the Dodgers. Both teams the Mets have played many times in the last 20 years or so in playoffs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs and Brewers are still in it as are the Tigers and Mariners. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Good luck to the fans of all these teams. I'm still watching. Tried to watch a Knicks preseason game last night and my heart wasn't in it yet. Will be soon. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, in case you didn't know, my team, the Mets, did not make the playoffs this year. I was actually relieved, it's been very painful to watch the team as we approached the end of the season.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Blasting the perf of timeline update on new post</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm trying out some new core code in the system-level stuff in WordLand. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The connection between the editor and the timeline when you post something new.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am going to try to build a shortcut between the two. When you post something for the first time, we notify the timeline component, and it adds it immediately, not waiting for the rssCloud loop to close. I don't want to wait.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I had the briefest taste of what it was like to work on mainframes in an office environment. We were able to do much more user-focused work when we did the programming on the user's machine. Big difference. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway. Back to my breakpoint.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I had the briefest taste of what it was like to work on mainframes in an office environment. We were able to do much more user-focused work when we did the programming on the user's machine. Big difference.&#10;&#10;Anyway. Back to my breakpoint.</source:markdown>
