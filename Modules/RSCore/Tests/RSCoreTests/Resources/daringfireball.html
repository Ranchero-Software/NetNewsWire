<p>SATCOM Security — a team of researchers from UC San Diego and the University of Maryland:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We pointed a commercial-off-the-shelf satellite dish at the sky
and carried out the most comprehensive public study to date of
geostationary satellite communication. A shockingly large amount
of sensitive traffic is being broadcast unencrypted, including
critical infrastructure, internal corporate and government
communications, private citizens’ voice calls and SMS, and
consumer Internet traffic from in-flight Wi-Fi and mobile
networks. This data can be passively observed by anyone with a few
hundred dollars of consumer-grade hardware. There are thousands of
geostationary satellite transponders globally, and data from a
single transponder may be visible from an area as large as 40% of
the surface of the earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The researchers don’t mention RCS by name, only SMS, but this a perfect example of why I thought <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/16/apple-rcs">Apple’s original stance on RCS</a> was correct, and their <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/02/eu_rcs_imessage">change of heart to support it last year</a> was unfortunate. No new protocol for messaging should be adopted unless the protocol exclusively works using end-to-end encryption.</p>

  <p>So what’s the net effect of this tiny little design detail that
the owner may not even understand? Well, it looks like the watch
is already half-way out of power after the first day, so <em>it
encourages the owner to wind the watch more frequently</em>. To keep
it closer to topped off, even when it’s not necessary. This helps
prevents the watch from running out of power, losing time, and,
ultimately, stopping. A stopped watch may be right twice a day,

<dd>
<p>Nick Heer, at Pixel Envy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First of all, the dollar is not the currency in any of these
countries. Second, the charger in European countries is €65, which
is more like $76 right now. Third, Apple is allowed to bundle an
A.C. adapter, it just needs to offer an option to not include it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Practically speaking, though, the EU directive regarding included chargers means Apple <em>won’t</em> include one, and likely no other laptop maker will either. They’d have to create, and stock, double the SKUs for every standard configuration. (If you buy a build-to-order configuration of the M5 MacBook Pro in Europe, you get a choice to include an adapter in the build-to-order workflow for an upcharge. If you buy a standard configuration model, you get the option to purchase a power adapter as a separate accessory.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fourth, and most important, is that the new MacBook Pro is less
expensive in nearly every region in which the A.C. adapter is
now a configure-to-order option — even after adding the
adapter. [...]</p>

<p>Countries with a charger in the box, on the other hand, see no
such price adjustment, at least for the ones I have checked. The
new M5 model starts at the same price as the M4 it replaces in
Canada, Japan, Singapore, and the United States. [...]</p>

<p>Maybe Apple was already planning a €100 price cut for these new
models. The M4 was €100 less expensive than the M3 it replaced,
for example, so it is plausible. That is something we simply
cannot know. What we do know for certain is that these new
MacBook Pros might not come with an A.C. adapter, but even if
someone adds one at checkout, it still costs less in most places
with this option.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that the new M5 MacBook Pro costs less than the M4 models, even when paying extra to include a new power adapter, leads me to suspect that Apple was planning price cuts in these countries regardless. As Heer points out, Apple cut the price by €100 when the base MacBook Pro went from the M3 to M4 a year ago. (<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/05/apple-announces-with-little-surprise-m4-macbook-airs">MacBook Air prices have been getting lower worldwide</a>, too.)</p>

<p>Anyway, the reason this regulation is subject to ridicule was never that European MacBook buyers were, effectively, paying for a charger that was no longer included. It’s that this is a silly law, and likely causes more harm than good. If Apple thought it was a good idea to no longer include power adapters in the box with MacBooks, they’d just stop including chargers in the box, worldwide. That’s what Apple started doing with iPhones <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/10/apple-announces-iphone-12-and-iphone-12-mini-a-new-era-for-iphone-with-5g/">with the iPhone 12 lineup <em>five years ago</em></a>. That wasn’t because of a law. It was because Apple thought it was a good idea.</p>

<p>The problem I see with the MacBook power adapter situation in Europe is that while power users — like the sort of people who read Daring Fireball and Pixel Envy — will have no problem buying exactly the sort of power adapter they want, or simply re-using a good one they already own, normal users have no idea what makes a “good” power adapter. I suspect there are going to be a lot of Europeans who buy a new M5 MacBook Pro and wind up charging it with inexpensive low-watt power adapters meant for things like phones, and wind up with a shitty, slow charging experience.</p>

<p>While poking fun at EU regulations leading Apple not to include a power adapter with the new M5 MacBook Pro across Europe, I wondered why the U.K. — which left the EU five years ago — was affected. DF reader <em>CA</em> wrote, via email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We did indeed leave the EU, but remain aligned to some of their
standards like food and consumer goods through a thing called the
Windsor Framework. Because the UK includes Northern Ireland, which
has an open border with the Republic of Ireland, and the RoI is
part of the EU, and the border MUST remain open for historical
reasons, there has to be a way of ensuring UK goods that don’t
meet EU standards don’t enter the EU via Northern Ireland. Hence,
we agreed to align to a selection of their standards to ensure the
border can stay open.</p>

<p>That’s why everything has to be USB-C and power supplies aren’t in
the M5 MacBook Pro boxes, but we aren’t affected by the DMA
shenanigans — those don’t apply to physical goods, only the
configuration of the software.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Something similar is surely the reason why the power adapter isn’t in the box for Norway, either — a country that has never been part of the EU. Here’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor_Framework">Wikipedia’s entry on the Windsor Framework</a>, and here’s a UK government “Call for Evidence” from a year ago <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/calls-for-evidence/common-charger-for-electrical-devices-call-for-evidence/common-charger-for-electrical-devices-call-for-evidence">regarding a requirement to follow the EU’s Common Charger Directive</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Name every pioneering personal computer you can think of from the
1970s. The MITS Altair 8800. The Apple-1. The IMSAI 8080. You may
even know about the SWTPC 6800 or Processor Technology Sol-20.</p>

<p>There’s a computer missing from that list, and it’s an important
one: Sphere Corporation’s Sphere 1. While far ahead of its
competitors in 1975 in what it delivered as an all-in-one PC,
Sphere’s manufacturing operations and cash flow lagged immediately
behind. The company collapsed so quickly that it was nearly erased
from the collective memory of that period.</p>

<p>But I know about Sphere. So does Bill Gates! And it just might
have sparked a few ideas in Steve Wozniak — though not as many as
Sphere’s founder later claimed.</p>

<p>I have a story to tell about this remarkable Utah-based company,
one that fills in the gaps in other histories of the era, and puts
Sphere in the context of the computers we have heard about again
and again for a half century. I want to tell you why Sphere was
important and worth remembering — and explain why they were
forgotten. While first to market with some important technologies,
“firsts” are not as interesting as how their visionary, imperfect
founder could see around corners. His reach far exceeded his
grasp, leading to his early exit and the company’s quick downfall.</p>

<p>Lizzie Dearden and Amelia Nierenberg, reporting for The New York Times (gift link):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For years, London’s police assumed most of the phone thefts were
the work of small-time thieves looking to make some quick cash.
But last December, they got an intriguing lead from a woman who
had used “Find My iPhone” to track her device to a warehouse near
Heathrow Airport. Arriving there on Christmas Eve, officers found
boxes bound for Hong Kong. They were labeled as batteries but
contained almost 1,000 stolen iPhones. [...]</p>

<p>The police are now using that information to map where stolen
phones are transported by street thieves. After the Heathrow
seizure, a team of specialist investigators who normally deal with
firearms and drug smuggling was assigned to the case. They
identified further shipments and used forensics to identify two
men in their 30s who are suspected of being ringleaders of a group
that sent up to 40,000 stolen phones to China.</p>

<p>When the men were arrested on Sept. 23, the car they were
traveling in contained several phones, some wrapped in aluminum
foil in an attempt to prevent them from transmitting tracking
signals. At one point, the police said at a news conference, they
observed the men buying almost 1.5 miles’ worth of foil in Costco.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While Hockney is perhaps best known for his larger-than-life
<a href="https://www.myartbroker.com/artist-david-hockney/collection-swimming-pools">swimming pool</a> paintings, bold coloured acrylics are
certainly not his only forte. Contrary to the old saying, Hockney
is a jack of all trades and a master of all he has worked with:
from paint to <a href="https://www.myartbroker.com/artist-david-hockney/series-the-yosemite-suite">iPads</a>. In the late 1980s, his fascination
with technology and new ways of creating art led him to the Xerox
photocopying machine. The copy machine offered Hockney his
speediest technique of printing yet, allowing the artist to build
layers, textures and colours like never before. However, it was
not only a swift and spontaneous way for Hockney to produce his
prints. The tech-savvy artist said that he had a more
“philosophical” interest in the Xerox machine as a new iteration
of the camera.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My post last week arguing that AI is a legitimate tool to create art has, as I expected, generated polarized feedback. One argument several readers have made is that AI generates nothing but <a href="https://www.404media.co/openais-sora-2-copyright-infringement-machine-features-nazi-spongebobs-and-criminal-pikachus/">plagiarism, copyright infringement, and slop</a>. That’s just not true. If a painter as renowned as David Hockney can use a literal photocopier as an artistic tool, AI can be one too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A major Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage took down multiple online
services for around four hours this morning, including Amazon,
Alexa, Snapchat, Fortnite, <a href="https://status.openai.com/incidents/01K80CBJD5Z64DF82KGT3K3QE0">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://x.com/EOSStatus/status/1980194104115150858">Epic Games Store,
Epic Online Services</a>, and more.</p>

<p>As of 6:35AM ET, the <a href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status">AWS status checker</a> is reporting that
“most AWS Service operations are succeeding normally now,” and
some of the impacted platforms, including <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1980249794502082948">Fortnite</a>,
<a href="https://x.com/EOSStatus/status/1980226546607726916">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/AravSrinivas/status/1980239929189036222">Perplexity</a> have announced
that they are fully recovered and back online.</p>

<p>However, as of 9:50AM ET, Amazon says that multiple services in
the US-EAST-1 Region are still “impacted” by operational issues,
and that it is working towards a full resolution. The AWS
dashboard first reported issues affecting the US-EAST-1 Region at
3:11AM ET, with global services in other regions also taken
offline. The cause of the outage hasn’t been confirmed, and it’s
unclear when regular service will be fully restored.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/compare/?modelList=MacBook-Air-M4,MacBook-Pro-14-M5,MacBook-Pro-14-M4-Pro">main link</a> on this post is to Apple’s ever-excellent Compare page for MacBooks, comparing the $1,000 M4 MacBook Air to the new $1,600 M5 MacBook Pro and, because there’s a third slot, the $2,000 M4 MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro chip. Stucki’s short list nails the actual advantages of the base MacBook Pro compared to the MacBook Air: much better display (1,000 nits vs. 500 nits, with the MBP supporting up to 1,600 nits for HDR content), better speakers, longer battery life, and SD/HDMI ports. Unmentioned by Stucki is that only the MacBook Pro offers the option for a nano-texture matte display for $150.</p>

<p>In my defense, I did say “probably” in my post. My understanding is that the base MacBook Pro is a huge seller for Apple. So of course some very well-informed users are buying them for good reasons. But I really do think an awful lot of base MacBook Pro buyers are spending an extra $600 and carrying 0.7 pounds of extra weight for features they don’t actually notice or care about. They just think they need a “pro” laptop, and underestimate just how incredibly capable MacBook Airs are.</p>

<dd>
<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/17/apple-formula-1">Speaking of</a> Eddy Cue, he was the guest on Matthew Belloni’s excellent podcast, The Town, this week. (<a href="https://overcast.fm/+AA4DU9C87M8">Overcast link</a>.) Just a great interview in general. Cue doesn’t do many interviews but he’s my favorite Apple executive to hear speak, because he’s the least rehearsed and most straightforward. If he doesn’t want to answer a question (Belloni tried, mightily, to press him on subscriber and viewership numbers), Cue just says he’s not going to answer that question, rather than dance around it with a non-answer answer.</p>

<p>My two big takeaways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Everyone in Hollywood is spooked about what Apple’s intentions “really are” regarding original movies and series. They’re worried it’s some sort of play to polish Apple’s brand, and that Apple is going to get bored or tired of losing money, and pick up stakes and leave the game. Cue emphasized that the answer is simple: Apple thinks it’s a great business to be in (and he also made the point that Apple’s brand needed no polishing) and they’re in this business for that reason, and for the long haul.</p></li>
<li><p>Apple is serious about sports rights, but they don’t want to dabble. They want to own the rights to entire sports. Friday Night Baseball was, effectively, a learning experiment. Apple TV’s MLS deal — and the F1 US deal announced today — are the sort of deals Apple wants. (That’s going to make it hard for Apple to get involved with the NFL, because the NFL strategically wants to spread its games across all the major TV networks <em>and</em> streaming services.) Cue is a huge sports fan (as is Tim Cook), and Apple wants to deliver sports on Apple TV that cater to fans.</p></li>

<p>Blockbuster sports streaming news from Apple Newsroom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple and Formula 1 today announced a five-year partnership that
will bring all F1 races exclusively to Apple TV in the United
States beginning next year. [...]</p>

<p>Apple TV will deliver comprehensive coverage of Formula 1, with
all practice, qualifying, Sprint sessions, and Grands Prix
available to Apple TV subscribers. Select races and all practice
sessions will also be available for free in the Apple TV app
throughout the course of the season. In addition to broadcasting
Formula 1 on Apple TV, Apple will amplify the sport across Apple
News, Apple Maps, Apple Music, and Apple Fitness+. Apple Sports — the free app for iPhone — will feature live updates for every
qualifying, Sprint, and race for each Grand Prix across the
season, with real-time leaderboards, season driver and constructor
standings, Live Activities to follow on the Lock Screen, and a
designated widget for the iPhone Home Screen.</p>

<p>F1 TV Premium, F1’s own premier content offering, will continue to
be available in the U.S. via an Apple TV subscription only and
will be free for those who subscribe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I’m reading this right, all you need to get access to <em>everything</em> F1-related is an Apple TV subscription (the service <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/13/apple-tv-minus">formerly known as TV+</a>) and to be in the US. This even includes <a href="https://f1tv.formula1.com/">F1 TV Premium</a> — normally $130/year — which <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/10/looking-for-the-red-flags-in-apples-formula-1-tv-deal/">Jason Snell wrote about</a> in a piece <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/14/snell-f1-apple">I linked to</a> earlier this week.</p>

<p>Basically, this sounds like the sort of sports broadcasting deal that Eddy Cue has been talking about as Apple’s goal for years — the rights to the entire sport, free of charge if you’re an Apple TV subscriber.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M5 chip does not include a
charger in the box in European countries, including the U.K.,
Ireland, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Norway,
and others, according to Apple’s online store. In the U.S. and all
other countries outside of Europe, the new MacBook Pro comes with
Apple’s 70W USB-C Power Adapter, but European customers miss out.</p>

<p>Apple has gradually stopped including chargers with many products
over the years — a decision it has attributed to its
environmental goals.</p>

<p>In this case, an Apple spokesperson <a href="https://x.com/LelloucheNico/status/1978510945224688060">told French website
Numerama’s Nicolas Lellouche</a> that the decision to not
include a charger with this particular MacBook Pro was made in
anticipation of a <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C_202402997">European regulation</a> that will require
Apple to provide customers with the option to purchase certain
devices without a charger in the box, starting in April.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not sure why there’s no power adapter in the box in the UK (<a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch-space-black-standard-display-apple-m5-chip-with-10-core-cpu-and-10-core-gpu-16gb-memory-512gb">I double-checked</a>). The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C_202402997">cited regulation</a> is for the EU, and the UK, rather famously, left the EU in 2020.</p>

<dd>
<p>Good and thoughtful graphic essay by Matthew Inman, expressing why he dislikes AI-generated art. It’s been widely <a href="https://kottke.org/25/10/0047680-the-oatmeals-take-on-ai">linked to</a>, largely approvingly. I fundamentally disagree with the premise. Near the start, Inman writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I consume AI art, it <em>also</em> evokes a feeling. Good, bad,
neutral — whatever.</p>

<p>Until I find out that it’s AI art.</p>

<p>Then I feel deflated, grossed out, and maybe a little bit bored.
This feeling isn’t a choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it very much is a choice. If your opinion about a work of art changes after you find out which tools were used to make it, or who the artist is or what they’ve done, you’re no longer judging the art. You’re making a choice not to form your opinion based on the work itself, but rather on something else. If you refuse to watch Woody Allen movies because of his personal life, that’s a choice, but you’re choosing not to watch <a href="https://www.avclub.com/amc-diane-keaton-annie-hall-somethings-gotta-give-re-release">some</a> of the <a href="https://woodyallen.com/manhattan/">best</a> <a href="https://woodyallen.com/match-point-2/">movies</a> that have <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/crimes-and-misdemeanors-1989">ever</a> been made.</p>

<p>Stanley Kubrick said, “The test of a work of art is, in the end, our affection for it, not our ability to explain why it is good.” If an image, a song, a poem, or video evokes affection in your heart, and then that affection dissipates when you learn what tools were used to create it, that’s not a test of the work of art itself. To me it’s no different than losing affection for a movie only upon learning that special effects were created digitally, not practically. Or whether a movie — or a photograph — was shot using a digital camera or on film. Or whether a novel was written using a computer or with pen and paper.</p>

<p>I think most “AI art” today completely sucks. But not because it was made using AI generation tools. It just sucks period. Good art is being made with AI tools, though, and more — much more — is coming.</p>

<p>Some thoughts and observations:</p>

<h2>14-Inch MacBook Pro</h2>

<p>Apple Newsroom: “<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-unveils-new-14-inch-macbook-pro-powered-by-the-m5-chip/">Apple Unveils New 14‑Inch MacBook Pro Powered by the M5 Chip, Delivering the Next Big Leap in AI for the Mac</a>”.</p>

<p>The 14-inch MacBook Pro with the no-adjective M-series chip has always been an odd duck in the MacBook lineup. This “Pro”-but-not-pro spot in the MacBook lineup goes back to the Intel era, when there was a 13-inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar. That was the MacBook Pro that, in 2016, Phil Schiller suggested as <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/new-macbook-pro-should-have-been-named-air/">a good choice for those who were then holding out for a MacBook Air with a retina display</a>. (The <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111933">first retina MacBook Air</a> didn’t ship for another two years, in late 2018.) It’s more like a MacBook “Pro” than a MacBook Pro. The truly <em>pro</em>-spec’d MacBook Pros have M-series Pro and Max chips, and are available in both 14- and 16-inch sizes. The base 14-inch model, with the no-adjective M-series chip, is for people who probably would be better served with a MacBook Air but who wrongly believe they “need” a laptop with “Pro” in its name.</p>

<p>Here’s a timeline of no-adjective M-series chips and when they appeared in the 14-inch MacBook Pro:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>M1 13-inch MacBook Pro: <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/11/introducing-the-next-generation-of-mac/">10 November 2020</a>. This MacBook Pro was one of the three Macs that debuted with the launch of Apple Silicon — the others were the MacBook Air and Mac Mini. The hardware looked exactly like the last generation Intel MacBook Pro. The M1 Pro and M1 Max models didn’t ship for another year (well, 11 months later), and those models brought with them the new form factor design that’s still with us today with the new M5 MacBook Pro.</p></li>
<li><p>M2 13-inch MacBook Pro: <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/06/apple-unveils-m2-with-breakthrough-performance-and-capabilities/">6 June 2022</a>. This model also stuck with the older Intel-era form factor, including the 13-inch, not 14-inch, display size.</p></li>
<li><p>M3 14-inch MacBook Pro: <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/apple-unveils-new-macbook-pro-featuring-m3-chips/">30 October 2023</a>. The “<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/behind-the-scenes-at-scary-fast-apples-keynote-event-shot-on-iphone/">Scary Fast</a>” event. This model debuted alongside the pro-spec’d M3 Pro and M3 Max 14- and 16-inch models.</p></li>
<li><p>M4 14-inch MacBook Pro: <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/10/new-macbook-pro-features-m4-family-of-chips-and-apple-intelligence/">30 October 2024</a>. Exactly one year after the M3, and also alongside the M4 Pro and M4 Max models. What was different in 2024 with the M4 generation is that <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-unveils-stunning-new-ipad-pro-with-m4-chip-and-apple-pencil-pro/">the M4 iPad Pros debuted back in early May</a>, all by themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>M5 14-inch MacBook Pro: <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-unveils-new-14-inch-macbook-pro-powered-by-the-m5-chip/">15 October 2025</a> (today). What’s different with today’s announcement is that it is <em>not</em> alongside the M5 Pro and M5 Max models, but <em>is</em> alongside the M5 iPad Pros.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This raises the question of when to expect those M5 Pro/Max models. The rumor mill suggests “early 2026”. I suspect that’s right, based on nothing other than the fact that if they were going to be announced this year, Apple almost certainly would have announced the entire M5 generation MacBook lineup together.</p>

<p>Basically, this is just a <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/compare/?modelList=MacBook-Pro-14-M5,MacBook-Pro-14-M4,MacBook-Pro-14-M4-Pro">speed bump upgrade over the just-plain M4 MacBook Pro</a>. But annual — or at least regular — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/05/good_old_fashioned_macbook_pro_speed_bumps">speed bumps are a good thing</a>. The alternative is years-long gaps between hardware refreshes.</p>

<h2>iPad Pros</h2>

<p>Apple Newsroom: “<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-introduces-the-powerful-new-ipad-pro-with-the-m5-chip/">Apple Introduces the Powerful New iPad Pro With the M5 Chip</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Featuring a next-generation GPU with a Neural Accelerator in each
core, M5 delivers a big boost in performance for iPad Pro users,
whether they’re working on cutting-edge projects or tapping into
AI for productivity. The new iPad Pro delivers up to 3.5× the AI
performance than iPad Pro with M4 and up to 5.6× faster than iPad
Pro with M1. N1, the new Apple-designed wireless networking chip,
enables the latest generation of wireless technologies with
support for Wi-Fi 7 on iPad Pro. The C1X modem comes to cellular
models of iPad Pro, delivering up to 50 percent faster cellular
data performance than its predecessor with even greater
efficiency, allowing users to do more on the go.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the N1 wireless chip and C1X modem are more interesting generation-over-generation improvements than the M5 chip. Thanks to the N1, these iPad Pro models support Wi-Fi 7 — today’s new M5 14-inch MacBook Pro does not. I would wager rather heavily that the upcoming M5 Pro and M5 Max MacBook Pro models <em>will</em> support Wi-Fi 7 (probably via the N1 chip, or perhaps even an “N1X” or something).</p>

<p>Other than that, this too <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad/compare/?modelList=ipad-pro-11-m5,ipad-pro-11-m4,ipad-air-11-m3">is a speed bump upgrade</a>.</p>

<h2>Vision Pro</h2>

<p>Apple Newsroom: “<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-vision-pro-upgraded-with-the-m5-chip-and-dual-knit-band/">Apple Vision Pro Upgraded With the M5 Chip and Dual Knit Band</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The upgraded Vision Pro also comes with the soft, cushioned Dual
Knit Band to help users achieve an even more comfortable fit, and
visionOS 26, which unlocks innovative spatial experiences,
including widgets, new Personas, an interactive Jupiter
Environment, and new Apple Intelligence features with support for
additional languages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The new Dual Knit Band (<a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/DUAL_KNIT_BAND_SA/apple-vision-pro-dual-knit-band">$99 on its own</a>) looks like a hybrid of the more attractive Solo Knit Band (which did not have a strap that went over the top of your head) and the Dual Loop Band (which did have an over-the-head strap, but which looked somewhat orthopedic). It’s a tacit acknowledgement that physical comfort has been a real problem for many people who’ve tried Vision Pro. (Me, personally, I find using it with the Solo Knit Band comfortable for as long as I care to use it — which is typically just 2–3 hours, tops.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are over 1 million apps and thousands of games on the App
Store, hundreds of 3D movies on the Apple TV app, and all-new
series and films in Apple Immersive with a selection of live NBA
games coming soon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Translation: <em>Hey, there’s actually a growing library of immersive content to watch, software to use, and games to play for this thing now.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With M5, Apple Vision Pro renders 10 percent more pixels on the
custom micro-OLED displays compared to the previous generation,
resulting in a sharper image with crisper text and more detailed
visuals. Vision Pro can also increase the refresh rate up to 120Hz
for reduced motion blur when users look at their physical
surroundings, and an even smoother experience when using Mac
Virtual Display. Vision Pro with M5 works alongside the
purpose-built R1 chip, which processes input from 12 cameras, five
sensors, and six microphones, and streams new images to the
displays within 12 milliseconds to create a real-time view of the
world. The high-performance battery now supports up to two and a
half hours of general use, and up to three hours of video
playback, all on a single charge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s merely another speed bump upgrade alongside the other two speed bump upgrades today, but a bit more dramatic given that the Vision Pro is jumping from the M2 to M5. No price drop, no change to the form factor. But Apple’s interest in the platform is very much alive.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘The Just Plain M5 Chip Launches in Three Updated Products: 14-Inch MacBook Pro, iPad Pro (Both Sizes), and Some Sort of Headset Thingamajig Called Vision Pro’" href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/10/m5_chip_launches_with_macbook_pro_ipad_pro_vision_pro">&#9733;</a></p>

<p>Luke Bouma, writing for Cord Cutters:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a seismic shift for the television industry, TiVo Corporation
has quietly pulled the plug on its storied digital video recorder
line, effectively ending an era that redefined how consumers
interacted with broadcast content. As of early October 2025, the
company’s <a href="https://www.tivo.com/">official website</a> has scrubbed all references
to its hardware DVR products, including the once-revered TiVo
Edge models designed for cable subscribers and over-the-air
antenna users. Visitors searching for these devices now encounter
a streamlined catalog that omits any mention of physical
recording hardware, signaling a complete withdrawal from the
retail DVR market.</p>

<p>This move culminates decades of gradual decline for TiVo’s
hardware ambitions, which peaked in the early 2000s when the brand
became synonymous with effortless time-shifting of television
programming. Launched in 1999, TiVo’s DVRs introduced features
like one-touch recording, commercial skipping, and intuitive
search capabilities that made traditional TV schedules feel
obsolete. At its zenith, the company boasted millions of
subscribers, forcing cable providers and networks to adapt to
empowered viewers who could pause live broadcasts or binge-watch
at will. The TiVo Edge, introduced in 2021 as a hybrid device
supporting both cable cards and streaming, represented the final
evolution of this hardware legacy, blending OTA tuners with 4K
support and expanded storage options. Yet, even as it garnered
praise for superior interface design and reliability, sales
dwindled amid the cord-cutting revolution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The writing has been on the wall for years. We’ve been a TiVo house for 25 years, but their hardware has gotten worse over the years. I forget what our second-to-last TiVo model was, but it died in 2021, and we bought a TiVo Edge. The Edge was often unreliable, and sometimes needed weekly reboots to keep working. (System software updates eventually fixed that.) But the hardware failed this summer. We’d only had it four years.</p>

<p>And, the Edge system software UI was a disaster, and a huge regression from the old TiVo interface. Almost everything was worse in the new “modern” TiVo interface from the old one: navigating shows you’d already recorded, the live-right-now TV guide, the interface for setting up a show to record — all of that went from really good and intuitive to clunky and confusing and slow. The one and only thing our TiVo Edge remained excellent at was playback. Fast-forwarding, rewinding, pausing — nothing else compares to TiVo for that. Even Apple’s own TV app on an Apple TV box doesn’t fast-forward or rewind with anything close to the precision and low latency TiVo’s devices have always offered. My first TiVo from 25 years ago had better fast-forward and rewind than anything on Apple TV (let alone other, lesser streaming boxes) today.</p>

<p>But the overall TiVo experience has been so bad — and getting worse — for so long that I’m not sad at all that they’re getting out of the game. TiVo’s one job was to provide a best-of-breed experience and they lost the plot on that a decade ago. Fuck ’em.</p>

  <p>Halo Fund, a new $1 billion growth fund founded by Ryan Smith and Ryan Sweeney, today announced a strategic secondary investment in 1Password, a leader in identity security and pioneer of Extended Access Management. Halo Fund is joined in this investment by legendary technology leaders, including Flume Ventures with Sun Microsystems founder Scott McNealy and former Zscaler Chief Strategy Officer Manoj Apte. This transaction underscores strong demand from innovators and investors to join 1Password’s journey.</p>

  <p>Apple’s new Liquid Glass interface design brings transparency and
blur effects to all Apple operating systems, but many users find
it distracting or difficult to read. Here’s how to control its
effects and make your interface more usable. Although the relevant
Accessibility settings are quite similar across macOS, iOS,
watchOS, and tvOS, I separate them because they offer different
levels of utility in each.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Comprehensive, illustrated overview of the various Accessibility settings (and, on MacOS 26 Tahoe, hidden command-line <code>defaults</code> settings) that let you adjust the transparency and contrast of Liquid Glass across the various Apple OS 26 interfaces. A useful guide for today — and, I bet, a useful look back at the first versions of Liquid Glass for the future.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The entire point of a streaming-only product is that once you’re
off traditional TV, you can go beyond the single stream and
provide interactive options. The whole point of streaming TV,
especially sports, should be that you can leave the flat video
stream behind and build something cool using software.</p>

<p>That is, by the way, what F1 TV Pro is: A sophisticated bit of
software that merges track data with multiple cameras to let
viewers choose how they want to watch races. It’s absolutely
the product that Apple should aspire to build, or co-opt, in
this deal.</p>

<p>I understand that Formula 1 owner Liberty Media is reluctant to
lose a profit center, but if Apple’s paying them an extra $50
million, isn’t that the proper trade-off? Also, working with Apple
in the U.S. could be part of a longer-term tech partnership
between F1 and Apple that could extend worldwide.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t really care about Apple obtaining sports streaming rights if all they’re going to do is stream a traditional linear broadcast of the games/events/races. I want to see Apple <em>do the Apple thing</em> and think deeply about what a software-based broadcast can be and offer — and then create it. So, to me, Apple’s Friday Night Baseball has been a wash. It’s a good broadcast (that, <a href="https://x.com/kendallbaker/status/1957930701086679514">rumors suggest</a>, may be coming to an end), but it’s <em>just</em> a good traditional baseball broadcast. It could be on any streaming service. The only Apple-y aspects are the designs and typography of the on-screen graphics and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/fox_new_scorebug_graphic_design">scorebug</a>. I want something like F1 TV Pro, but for baseball — and eventually, for all sports.</p>

  <p>Apple TV+ is now simply Apple TV, with a vibrant new identity.
Ahead of its global streaming debut on Apple TV, the film
continues to be available for purchase on participating digital
platforms, including the Apple TV app, Amazon Prime Video,
Fandango at Home and more.</p>

<p><strong>About Apple TV</strong></p>

<p>Apple TV is available on the Apple TV app in over 100 countries
and regions, on over 1 billion screens, including iPhone, iPad,
Apple TV, Apple Vision Pro, Mac, popular smart TVs from Samsung,
LG, Sony, VIZIO, TCL and others, Roku and Amazon Fire TV devices,
Chromecast with Google TV, PlayStation and Xbox gaming consoles,
and at tv.apple.com, for $12.99 per month with a seven-day free
trial for new subscribers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In some ways, I get it. Like, if you’re telling someone how much you enjoy <em>Slow Horses</em> and they ask how to watch it, it’s more natural and conversational to just say “It’s on Apple TV”. That’s what most people say. That’s what I say — and as part of my job, I completely understand the difference between Apple TV the device, Apple TV the (free) app, and Apple TV+ the (paid) streaming service.</p>

<p>But right there in Apple’s own “About Apple TV” description, you see just how overused “Apple TV” now is. You can watch Apple TV in Apple TV on Apple TV — the paid service in the free app on the set-top box. But you can watch any streaming service you want on the box, in that service’s own app. But many of those services are also available in the Apple TV app. And the Apple TV streaming service is also available on just about all other popular set-top hardware platforms. So you don’t need an Apple TV to watch Apple TV. It’s a bit like Abbott and Costello’s classic “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYOUFGfK4bU">Who’s on First</a>” routine.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Clips is such an interesting story. It really was a great app. Back in 2017, when version 2.0 arrived (just six months after 1.0), <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/11/10/clips-2-0">I described it as</a> “the single best example of a productivity app designed for iOS”. I stand by that. Clips was a very ambitious app that really pushed the state of the art in iOS UI design forward in so many ways. The general knock on iOS has always been that it’s a platform for content consumption, not creation. Clips was <em>all about</em> creation.</p>

<p>But, for as many great ideas as Clips contained (and debuted), it clearly never clicked with the public. Most people — even just only counting people who create and share edited videos to social media — probably have never even heard of Clips. There was something essential missing: a use case. <a href="https://thatrandomagency.com/2025/06/09/instagram-edits-app-review/">Edits</a>, Meta’s new-this-year video editing app for mobile, has a clear use case: it’s meant for editing videos destined for Meta’s popular social media networks. Clips had no clear target destination. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/remember-clips">It could have</a>, but never did.</p>

  <p>The world’s largest and most disruptive botnet is now drawing a

concentration of infected devices at U.S. providers is
complicating efforts to limit collateral damage from the botnet’s
attacks, which shattered previous records this week with a brief
traffic flood that clocked in at nearly 30 trillion bits of data
per second.</p>

<p>Since its debut more than a year ago, the Aisuru botnet has
steadily outcompeted virtually all other IoT-based botnets in the

<p>No president, of course, can be expected to remember everything that happened during his four-year term. But Trump, of course, was still president on January 6, and the events that day were — to say the least — historically significant. The entire point of the January 6 insurrection — for his role in which, Trump was impeached — was to <em>prevent</em> Joe Biden from becoming president on January 20.</p>

<p>Nellie Andreeva, reporting for Deadline back on September 23:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The release of Apple TV+’s <em>The Savant</em> has been put on hold. The
decision comes three days before the thriller starring Jessica
Chastain was slated to premiere on the streamer Sept. 26. No new
date has been set.</p>

<p>“After careful consideration, we have made the decision to
postpone The Savant,” an Apple TV+ spokesperson said in a
statement to Deadline. “We appreciate your understanding and look
forward to releasing the series at a future date.”</p>

<p>The streamer would not elaborate on the reasons for the
last-minute change but <em>The Savant</em>’s subject matter is believed
to be behind it, with the storyline about preventing extremist
attacks and some of the imagery considered possibly triggering
following the Sept. 10 assassination of right-wing political
activist Charlie Kirk. The series includes a sniper in action and
the bombing of a government building among other acts of violence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jessica Chastain, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DO_V2EyEZmj/">in a post on Instagram later that same day</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to say how much I value my partnership with Apple.
They’ve been incredible collaborators and I deeply respect their
team. That said, I wanted to reach out and let you know that
we’re not aligned on the decision to pause the release of <em>The
Savant</em>. [...]</p>

<p>I’ve never shied away from difficult subjects, and while I wish
this show wasn’t so relevant, unfortunately it is. <em>The Savant</em>
is about the heroes who work every day to stop violence before it
happens, and honoring their courage feels more urgent than ever.
While I respect Apple’s decision to pause the release for now, I
remain hopeful the show will reach audiences soon. Until then,
I’m wishing safety and strength for everyone, and I’ll let you
know if and when <em>The Savant</em> is released.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here we are nearly three weeks later, and it’s still a question of <em>if</em>, not <em>when</em> — <a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/the-savant/umc.cmc.aar44keiny3h54xvaakg260q">Apple TV’s page for <em>The Savant</em></a> still has it labeled “Coming: At a Later Date”. </p>

  <p>Saul Zabar, who across more than seven decades as a principal
owner of the Upper West Side food emporium bearing his family name
kept New Yorkers amply fortified with smoked fish, earthy bread
and tangy cheese, not to mention pungent coffee, died on Tuesday
in Manhattan. He was 97. [...]</p>

<p>What did he look for in a fish? His response to The New York Sun
in 2007 was worthy of a cryptic Zen master: “It’s got to have
taste. Not too this, not too that.”</p>

<p>But he was clear about his store’s iconic status. “There’s a
romance about what we do,” he said in 2012. “We have a modern
appearance, but we really do things the way they were done 40, 50,
75, even 200 years ago.” [...]</p>

<p>“We get asked often why we don’t franchise, because we have a lot
of branded products,” <a href="https://www.ediblemanhattan.com/tastemakers/the_brothers_zabar">he told the magazine Edible Manhattan in
2022</a>.</p>

<p>“Money is not why we do this, not why we’re here seven days a
week,” he said. “It’s a way of life for us. It’s kind of
old-fashioned.”</p>

the art was unveiled on the weekend to coincide with James Bond
Day celebrations on Sunday.</p>

<p>Bond fans quickly noticed that the artwork had undergone some
amateur photoshopping, which either cropped or airbrushed out
his signature Walther PPK gun from the original image in a
variety of ways.</p>

<p>The results were widely derided on social media; films like <em>Dr.
No</em> and <em>Goldeneye</em> appeared to have Bond making a rude gesture,
while others like <em>A View to a Kill</em> elongated Roger Moore’s arms
well past the point of any human.</p>

<p>Pablo Manríquez, reporting for Migrant Insider:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has quietly removed DeICER, a civic-reporting app used to
log immigration enforcement activity, from its App Store after a
law enforcement complaint — invoking a rule normally reserved for
protecting marginalized groups from hate speech.</p>

<p>According to internal correspondence reviewed by Migrant Insider,
Apple told developer Rafael Concepcion that the app violated
Guideline 1.1.1, which prohibits “defamatory, discriminatory, or
mean-spirited content” directed at “religion, race, sexual
orientation, gender, national/ethnic origin, or other targeted
groups.”</p>

<p>But Apple’s justification went further. “Information provided to
Apple by law enforcement shows that your app violates Guideline
1.1.1 because its purpose is to provide location information
about law enforcement officers that can be used to harm such
officers individually or as a group,” the company wrote in its
removal notice.</p>

<p>The decision effectively treats federal immigration agents as a
protected class — a novel interpretation of Apple’s hate-speech
policy that shields one of the most powerful arms of government
from public scrutiny.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Delicate flowers, these ICE agents are. And it’s a lie, anyway. There’s not one story about any of these apps being used to harm ICE agents. And even if such an attack happened, that wouldn’t imply it’s the <em>purpose</em> of these apps. The purpose of these apps is to protect people — citizens and non-citizens alike — <em>from ICE</em>.</p>

<p>Alas, <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-calls-ice-agents-a-vulnerable-group-removes-ice-spotting-app-red-dot/">there’s no more courage, conviction, or honesty from Google</a> on the Android side of the fence either.</p>

<p>It’d be both interesting and honest if either Apple or Google justified these app bannings by simply saying the Trump administration demanded them and that they — Apple and Google — fear reprisal from Trump if they don’t comply.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple removed an app for preserving TikToks, Instagram reels, news
reports, and videos documenting abuses by ICE, 404 Media has
learned. The app, called Eyes Up, differs from other banned apps
such as ICEBlock which were designed to report sightings of ICE
officials in real-time to warn local communities. Eyes Up,
meanwhile, was more of an aggregation service pooling together
information to preserve evidence in case the material is needed in
the future in court.</p>

<p>The news shows <a href="https://www.404media.co/iceblock-owner-after-apple-removes-app-we-are-determined-to-fight-this/">that Apple</a> <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-calls-ice-agents-a-vulnerable-group-removes-ice-spotting-app-red-dot/">and Google’s</a> crackdown
on ICE-spotting apps, which started after pressure from the
Department of Justice against Apple, is broader in scope than apps
that report sightings of ICE officials. It has also impacted at
least one app that was more about creating a historical record of
ICE’s activity during its mass deportation effort.</p>

<p>“Our goal is government accountability, we aren’t even doing
real-time tracking,” the administrator of Eyes Up, who said their
name was Mark, told 404 Media. Mark asked 404 Media to only use
his first name to protect him from retaliation. “I think the
[Trump] admin is just embarrassed by how many incriminating
videos we have.”</p>

<p>Benoit Berthelot and Gaspard Sebag, reporting for Bloomberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple Inc. faces an investigation in France over the use of voice
recordings made with its assistant Siri. The probe has been
referred to the Office for Combating Cybercrime, the Paris
prosecutor’s office said in a statement on Monday. An Apple
spokesperson referred to <a href="https://www.apple.com/jo/newsroom/2025/01/our-longstanding-privacy-commitment-with-siri/">a blog post</a> the company published in
January about its use of voice recordings, and declined to comment
further.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/le-parquet-de-paris-ouvre-une-enquete-sur-siri-lassistant-vocal-dapple/">Politico earlier reported</a> the investigation.</p>

<p>The investigation concerns Apple’s collection of user recordings
through Siri, the digital assistant available on most of its
devices. Apple can record and retain audio interactions through
Siri to help improve its services, a feature the company says is
opt-in. Some of that data can be retained for up to two years and
reviewed by “graders”, or subcontractors, <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/improve-siri-dictation/">according to Apple</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sending recorded Siri voice interactions to Apple <em>is</em> opt-in, and the opt-in screen is very clear and cogent. It’s not just something Apple claims.</p>

<p>Amazing stuff continues to happen in the EU.</p>

  <p>I think that’s the real revelation here. It’s less about
consumption and more about <em>creation</em>. I <a href="https://500ish.com/wither-on-the-vine-d8893fddf07e?ref=spyglass.org">previously wrote</a>
about how I was an early investor in Vine in part because it felt
like it could be analogous to Instagram. Thanks in large part to
filters, that app made it easy for anyone to think they were good
enough to be a photographer. It didn’t matter if they were or not,
they <em>thought</em> they were — I was one of them — so everyone
posted their photos. Vine felt like it could have been that for
video thanks to its clever tap-to-record mechanism. But actually,
it became a network for a lot of really talented amateurs to
figure out a new format for funny videos on the internet. When
Twitter acquired the company and dropped the ball, TikTok took
that idea and scaled it (thanks to ByteDance paying um, <em>Meta</em>
billions of dollars for distribution, and their own very smart
algorithms).</p>

<p>In a way, Sora feels like enabling everyone to be a TikTok
creator.</p>

<p>I don’t want to predict if Sora is a fad or has staying power, but so far <a href="https://sora.chatgpt.com/p/s_68e5c38a9d28819193068a89359164f7">I enjoy it</a> in a way that I haven’t enjoyed a new social network in years.

<h6 class="dateline">Friday,  3 October 2025</h6>

<p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/apple-takes-down-ice-tracking-app-after-pressure-from-ag-bondi">Ashley Oliver, reporting for Fox Business</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>DOJ officials, at the direction of Attorney General Pam Bondi,
asked Apple to take down ICEBlock, a move that comes as Trump
administration officials have claimed the tool, which allows users
to anonymously report ICE agents’ presence, puts agents in danger
and helps shield illegal immigrants.</p>

<p>“We reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock
app from their App Store — and Apple did so,” Bondi said in a
statement to Fox News Digital.</p>

<p>“ICEBlock is designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing
their jobs, and violence against law enforcement is an intolerable
red line that cannot be crossed,” Bondi added. “This Department of
Justice will continue making every effort to protect our brave
federal law enforcement officers, who risk their lives every day
to keep Americans safe.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fox, in its opening paragraph, describes Bondi as having “asked” Apple to remove ICEBlock from the App Store, but Bondi’s own statement uses the verb “demand”. The difference is not nitpicking. No one, not even Bondi, is claiming any aspect of ICEBlock is illegal. Thus it’s not merely inappropriate but outrageous — and yet another among dozens of other causes for alarm regarding Trump 2.0’s decidedly authoritarian turn — for the DOJ to “demand” that Apple do anything about it. But demand they did, and comply did Apple. (Check those lips <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/i_wonder">for Cheetos dust</a> before heading home today.)</p>

<p>Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert, Peter Kafka, and Kwan Wei Kevin Tan, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-iceblock-app-store-removed-2025-10">reporting for Business Insider</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has removed ICEBlock, an app that allowed users to monitor
and report the location of immigration enforcement officers, from
the App Store.</p>

<p>“We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to
discover apps,” Apple said in a statement to Business Insider.
“Based on information we’ve received from law enforcement about
the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and
similar apps from the App Store.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ICEBlock developer Joshua Aaron, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/iceblock.app/post/3m2alyaghbk2n">posting on the ICEBlock Bluesky account</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We just received a message from Apple’s App Review that #ICEBlock
has been removed from the App Store due to “objectionable
content”. The only thing we can imagine is this is due to pressure
from the Trump Admin.</p>

<p>We have responded and we’ll fight this! #resist</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is clearly nothing illegal about ICEBlock.<sup id="fnr1-2025-10-03"><a href="#fn1-2025-10-03">1</a></sup> It’s just information, obviously protected by the First Amendment. Law enforcement officers in the United States have no right to avoid being recorded nor their actions being reported and shared. Reporting and publishing where police are policing is free speech and fundamental to the civil rights and liberties of a free society.</p>

<p>We can all wish Apple had fought this “demand”. I certainly do. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohPToBog_-g">John Oliver’s “Fuck you, make me”</a> argument <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/03/fuck-you-make-me">sprung to mind</a> for me this morning. But that’s wishful thinking. I believe there are many lines Apple would not cross, even if it means taking on the ire of Trump administration lickspittles, if not the barely literate wrath of the mad king himself on <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/06/truth_social_is_just_trumps_blog">his sad little blog</a>. Apple may well eventually — if not soon — be forced to define those lines. But keeping ICEBlock in the App Store isn’t one of them. You might believe it should be. There’s a big part of me that believes it should be. But I can also <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/08/gold_frankincense_and_silicon">see why it’s not</a>. Pick your battles.</p>

<p>I wrote about ICEBlock twice back in late July. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/07/iceblock">Quoting extensively from my initial post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ICEBlock app is interesting in and of itself (and from my
tire-kicking test drive, appears to be a well-crafted and designed
app), as will be Apple’s response if (when?) the Trump
administration takes offense to the app’s existence. Back in 2019,
kowtowing to tacit demands from China, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/10/10/apple-pulls-hkmaps">Apple removed from the App
Store an app called HKmap.live</a> which helped pro-democracy
activists in Hong Kong know the location of police and protest
activity. The app broke no Hong Kong laws, but <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/10/10/768841864/after-china-objects-apple-removes-app-used-by-hong-kong-protesters">scared the
thin-skinned skittish lickspittles in the Chinese Communist
Party</a>. (Remember too that in 2019, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/10/07/taiwan-flag-emoji">Apple removed the Taiwan
flag emoji</a> (🇹🇼) from the iOS 13 keyboard for users in Hong
Kong and Macau.)</p>

<p>One defense from Apple regarding HKmap.live, however, was that the
iOS app was a thin wrapper around the website, which website
remained fully functional and could be saved to an iPhone user’s
home screen. Removing the app from the App Store thus did not
prevent Hongkongers from accessing it. (<a href="https://hkmap.live/">That website</a> today
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HKmap.live">seems to be defunct</a>.)</p>

<p>ICEBlock is different. It is <em>only</em> available as a native iOS app.
According to the developers, this is for technical reasons. From
their web page explaining <a href="https://www.iceblock.app/android">why they <em>can’t</em> offer an Android
version</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At ICEBlock, user privacy and security are paramount. Our
application is designed to provide as much anonymity as possible
without storing any user data or creating accounts. While we
understand the desire for an Android version of ICEBlock,
achieving this level of anonymity on Android is not feasible due
to the inherent requirements of push notification services.</p>

<p>To send push notifications on Android, it is necessary to use a
mechanism that requires storing device IDs. This means that we
would need to maintain a privately hosted database to store these
identifiers. Storing such data, even if it’s anonymized,
introduces significant privacy risks. [...]</p>

<p>In contrast, iOS offers us the flexibility to deliver push
notifications while adhering strictly to our design philosophy.
Apple’s ecosystem allows for push notifications to be sent
without requiring us to store any user-identifiable information.
This ensures that ICEBlock remains completely anonymous and
secure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To deliver push notifications on Android, the developers claim
they would need to maintain a database of device IDs, create a
user account system to manage those device IDs, and all of that
server-stored data would be susceptible to law enforcement
subpoenas and pro-ICE red hat hackers. (What “brown shirts” were
to the Nazis, we should make “red hats” to MAGA.)</p>

<p>To maintain anonymity and store zero user data, there is and can
be no web app version of ICEBlock. There is and can be no Android
version. Only iOS supports the security and privacy features for
ICEBlock to offer what it does, the way it does. Here’s to hoping
that Apple will proudly defend it if push comes to shove.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple’s removal of ICEBlock from the App Store is, in multiple ways, <em>worse</em> than Apple’s removal of HKmap.live from the App Store back in 2019. First, you cannot take a disagreement with the Chinese government to court. Here in the United States, you can. But Apple chose not to. That’s a display of weakness. </p>

<p>Second, from the perspective of users, without the HKmap.live “app”, Hong Kong iPhone users could still access all the functionality via the website, and the website could be saved to their home screens as a web app that was, I believe, functionally identical to the version from the App Store. I put “app” in quotes above because the HKmap.live app was really just a thin wrapper around the service’s mobile website. Hongkongers lost some convenience, and they lost the ability to tell non-technical protestor friends “just get it from the App Store”, but it’s not <em>that</em> much more complex to explain how to add a website to your iPhone home screen as a web app.</p>

<p>With ICEBlock, the entire thing is simply no longer available. If you already have ICEBlock installed, the installed version still functions on your iPhone, but, until and if Apple changes its mind, there will be no further software updates and new users are unable to download it. Nor will current users be able to re-download the app on a new iPhone — and now is “new iPhone” season. And, seemingly, there can be no web app (or Android) version of ICEBlock that offers the same level of anonymity as the native iOS version — with notifications, but without user accounts nor any database of device IDs for notifications that would be subject to subpoena from ICEBlock.</p>

<p>The gist of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/07/26/iceblock-trust-apple">my second post on ICEBlock</a> from back in July is that ICEBlock’s privacy-protecting architecture isn’t magic. It’s based on trust in Apple itself. Joshua Aaron doesn’t have access to ICEBlock users’ device IDs (let alone their personal identities), but ICEBlock can send push notifications to devices because Apple itself does know device IDs and users’ identities.</p>

<p>It’s rather chilling to consider what Apple would have done if the Trump administration had “demanded” a list of device IDs and user identities for everyone who had installed ICEBlock. Or what Apple <em>will</em> do if such a demand pops into one of their dimwitted but cruel minds.<sup id="fnr2-2025-10-03"><a href="#fn2-2025-10-03">2</a></sup> I suspect that’s one of the lines Apple would not cross. That Apple would stand its ground there and say “Fuck you, make us” and take it to court. But there’s only one way to find out.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘Complying With ‘Demand’ From Trump Administration, Apple Removes ICEBlock From App Store’" href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/10/iceblock_removed_from_app_store">&#9733;</a></p>

<li id="fn1-2025-10-03">
<p>It’s interesting to consider how Aaron might “fight this”. I don’t think suing the Department of Justice is an option. All Pam Bondi did was issue a “demand” to Apple. That’s inappropriate and an embarrassment, and in any normal administration would be just cause for her immediate dismissal from the job. But it’s not against the law. She didn’t issue an unconstitutional legal demand to Apple. She just issued a verbal request with an implicit threat of turning the nation’s MAGA derps and Fox News junkies against Apple. What Apple was afraid of wasn’t fighting this demand in a court of law, but in the court of public opinion.</p>

<p>So maybe Aaron sues Apple? I’m not sure he has grounds for that either, but it’d be interesting to see Apple’s lawyers argue in court that the App Store is no place for apps that protect users’ civil liberties and personal privacy.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2025-10-03"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>

<li id="fn2-2025-10-03">
<p>A few people have already asked me why it took the Trump administration several months to put ICEBlock in its crosshairs and issue a takedown “demand” to Apple. <a href="https://abc7ny.com/post/iceblock-new-iphone-app-lets-users-know-when-ice-agents-are-area/16902392/">Aaron shipped the first release of ICEBlock back in April</a>, and it achieved a significant amount of well-deserved publicity in July after Trump’s ICE goons began large-scale deportation raids in Los Angeles. My answer is simple: it took them months to issue this demand because they’re so goddamn stupid and incompetent. We should be thankful for that. In a competent regime attempting an authoritarian takeover of a liberal democracy, it would have been taken down in days, not months.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2025-10-03"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

<h6 class="dateline">Friday, 26 September 2025</h6>

<p>Apple, “<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/the-digital-markets-acts-impacts-on-eu-users/">The Digital Markets Act’s Impacts on EU Users</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The DMA requires Apple to make certain features work on non-Apple
products and apps before we can share them with our users.
Unfortunately, that requires a lot of engineering work, and it’s
caused us to delay some new features in the EU:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Live Translation</em> with AirPods uses Apple Intelligence to let
Apple users communicate across languages. Bringing a
sophisticated feature like this to other devices creates
challenges that take time to solve. For example, we designed
Live Translation so that our users’ conversations stay private — they’re processed on device and are never accessible to Apple — and our teams are doing additional engineering work to make
sure they won’t be exposed to other companies or developers
either.</p></li>
<li><p><em>iPhone Mirroring</em> lets our users see and interact with their
iPhone from their Mac, so they can seamlessly check their
notifications, or drag and drop photos between devices. Our
teams still have not found a secure way to bring this feature to
non-Apple devices without putting all the data on a user’s
iPhone at risk. And as a result, we have not been able to bring
the feature to the EU. [...]</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We’ve suggested changes to these features that would protect our
users’ data, but so far, the European Commission has rejected our
proposals. And according to the European Commission, under the
DMA, it’s illegal for us to share these features with Apple users
until we bring them to other companies’ products. If we shared
them any sooner, we’d be fined and potentially forced to stop
shipping our products in the EU.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Live Translation with AirPods and iPhone Mirroring are both <em>amazing</em> features. And EU users are missing out on them. I think Apple structured this piece exactly right, by emphasizing first that the most direct effect of the DMA is that EU users are getting great features late — or never. And that list of features is only going to grow over time.</p>

<p>Under the section “Is the DMA Achieving Its Goals?”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Regulators claimed the DMA would promote competition and give
European consumers more choices. But the law is not living up to
those promises. In fact, it’s having some of the opposite effects:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Fewer choices</em>: When features are delayed or unavailable, EU
users don’t get the same options as users in the rest of the
world. They lose the choice to use Apple’s latest technologies,
and their devices fall further behind.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Less differentiation</em>: By forcing Apple to build features and
technologies for non-Apple products, the DMA is making the
options available to European consumers more similar. For
instance, the changes to app marketplaces are making iOS look
more like Android — and that reduces choice.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Unfair competition</em>: The DMA’s rules only apply to Apple, even
though Samsung is the smartphone market leader in Europe, and
Chinese companies are growing fast. Apple has led the way in
building a unique, innovative ecosystem that others have copied — to the benefit of users everywhere. But instead of rewarding
that innovation, the DMA singles Apple out while leaving our
competitors free to continue as they always have.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This is all true. But I have a better way to put this. If Apple were to just switch the iPhone’s OS from iOS to Android, these DMA conflicts would all go away. Apple’s not going to do that, of course, but to me it’s a crystallizing way of looking at it. The DMA is supposedly intended to increase “competition”, which in turn should increase consumer choice. But the easiest way for Apple to comply with the DMA would be to switch EU iPhones to Android — which, by a significant margin, already has majority mobile OS market share in the EU. <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/europe/">Here’s a link to StatCounter’s mobile OS stats for Europe</a> (<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/03/eu_share_of_apples_revenue">which is not the same as the EU</a>, but as good a proxy as I could find). It’s two-thirds Android, one-third iOS — a 2-1 ratio.</p>

<p>If Apple just shipped all EU iPhones with Android instead of iOS, all of their DMA problems would be off the table. EU iPhone users would lose <em>all</em> iOS exclusive features and Apple device <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/continuity/">Continuity</a> integrations. EU consumers would effectively have no choice at all in mobile OSes. They’d just get to choose which brand of Android phone to buy.</p>

<p>How in the world would that increase competition? iOS’s unique and exclusive features — which, yes, in many cases, are exclusive to the Apple device ecosystem — <em>are competition</em>.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘Apple on the Digital Markets Act’" href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/09/apple_on_the_digital_markets_act">&#9733;</a></p>
