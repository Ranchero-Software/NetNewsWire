   @function FourCharCode()
   @brief    FourCharCode values like OSType, DescType or AEKeyword  are really just 
             4 byte values commonly represented as values like 'odoc' where each byte is 
             represented as its ASCII character.  This function turns a swift string into 
             its FourCharCode equivalent, as swift doesn't recognize FourCharCode types 
             natively just yet.  With this extension, one can use
                  "odoc".FourCharCode()
             where one would really want to use 'odoc'
