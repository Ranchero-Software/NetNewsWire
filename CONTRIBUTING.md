# Contributing

We welcome contributions ‚Äî¬†but it‚Äôs **really important to ask first** before working on a new feature or bug fix. Just because the app is open source doesn‚Äôt mean we add features just whenever someone codes one up. The app is planned the same way it would be if it weren‚Äôt open source. (See NetNewsWire [milestones](https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire/milestones).)

Also: just because a ticket exists doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre going to implement a fix or feature. Or not now, or not before some other things happen first.

Here‚Äôs how to contribute:

1. Find or file a ticket describing the bug you want to fix or feature you want to add.
2. On the [Slack group](https://netnewswire.com/slack), bring it up on the #work channel for discussion (which may or may not include implementation discussion). **This is very important, because there might be things you need to know before you start work.** We might also, for whatever reason, not want to do that feature, not do it this year, do it in a very different way, or whatever. Or it may be that a given bug fix should come after some other refactoring, for instance.
3. Once approved, then go for it. Write the code, then do a pull request. We‚Äôll either have comments or we‚Äôll merge it. (We might revise it afterward, of course.)

## Notes

It‚Äôs important that the pull request merge cleanly with `main`. It must add no more warnings than we already have. (We try to keep warnings at zero, but aren‚Äôt always successful.)

You should have read the [coding guidelines](Technotes/CodingGuidelines.md) first. If your code doesn‚Äôt follow the guidelines, we will likely suggest revising it.

Patience may be required at times. Brent isn‚Äôt always available ‚Äî¬†just because of life. üê•

Our code of conduct is below.

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting Brent Simmons via direct message on the [Slack group](https://netnewswire.com/slack). All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
