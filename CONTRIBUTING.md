# Contributing

We welcome contributions — but it’s **really important to ask first** before working on a new feature or bug fix. Just because the app is open source doesn’t mean we add features just whenever someone codes one up. The app is planned the same way it would be if it weren’t open source. (See NetNewsWire [milestones](https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire/milestones).)

Also: just because a ticket exists doesn’t mean we’re going to implement a fix or feature. Or not now, or not before some other things happen first.

Here’s how to contribute:

1. Find or file a ticket describing the bug you want to fix or feature you want to add.
2. On the [Slack group](https://netnewswire.com/slack), bring it up on the #work channel for discussion (which may or may not include implementation discussion). **This is very important, because there might be things you need to know before you start work.** We might also, for whatever reason, not want to do that feature, not do it this year, do it in a very different way, or whatever. Or it may be that a given bug fix should come after some other refactoring, for instance.
3. Once approved, then go for it. Write the code, then do a pull request. We’ll either have comments or we’ll merge it. (We might revise it afterward, of course.)

By participating, you agree to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Notes

It’s important that the pull request merge cleanly with `main`. It must add no more warnings than we already have. (We try to keep warnings at zero, but aren’t always successful.)

You should have read the [coding guidelines](Technotes/CodingGuidelines.md) first. If your code doesn’t follow the guidelines, we will likely suggest revising it.

Patience may be required at times. Brent isn’t always available — just because of life. 🐥
