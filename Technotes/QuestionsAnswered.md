#### How do I delete a feed?

Select it in the sidebar, then hit the Delete key. Or choose Edit > Delete from the menubar.

Note: you can delete multiple feeds, and you can delete folders. You can also undo if you change your mind.

#### Why does Evergreen require the latest macOS?

Since Evergreen is a nights-and-weekends project, we don’t have enough time to run and test on older versions of macOS. Most of the time it will require the most recent macOS.

#### Why is FeedBin syncing planned for 1.0 but  _____ isn’t planned until 2.0?

This was a difficult decision. We didn’t want to ship with no syncing at all, but we also didn’t want to delay shipping until we’ve done a whole bunch of systems.

So we chose FeedBin, since that’s what we use, and since the folks at FeedBin have been friendly and helpful.
