# The On My Mac account

The On My Mac account is the simplest way to use NetNewsWire. Using it requires no additional service or software. It’s just you, your subscriptions and NetNewsWire.

On My Mac subscriptions are wholly managed by NetNewsWire. It keeps your subscription list and is responsible for fetching the feeds and checking for updates. This means it also keeps track of what items you’ve read or not.

The On My Mac account does not sync this data to any other location. It works best for those people who only read NetNewsWire feeds on one Mac and nowhere else.

*NetNewsWire can also be used with a [syncing account](syncing-accounts.html) service like Feedbin.*


Refreshing On My Mac feeds
--------------------------

The feeds in the On My Mac account will be refreshed automatically whenever you open NetNewsWire. If left open, NetNewsWire will refresh your feeds every hour, or according to the schedule you set in Preferences.



If you don’t use the On My Mac account
--------------------------------------

If you only use a syncing account with NetNewsWire, you may want to hide or disable the On My Mac account.
